I’m hoping that the individual essays can be read fairly well on their own, but see __this introduction_ _  for a summary of the essays that have been released thus far, and for a bit more about the series as a whole.)_\n\n# 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe first essay in this series defined the alignment problem; the second tried to clarify when this problem arises. In this essay, I want to lay out a high-level picture of how I think about getting from here either to a solution, or to some acceptable alternative. In particular:\n\n  * I distinguish between the underlying technical parameters relevant to the alignment problem (the “problem profile”) and our civilization’s capacity to respond adequately to a given version of the problem (our “competence profile”).\n  * I lay out a framework for thinking about what competence in this respect consists in – one that highlights the role for three key “security factors,” namely:\n    *  _Safety progress_ : our ability to develop new levels of AI capability safely;\n    *  _Risk evaluation:_ our ability to track and forecast the level of risk that a given sort of AI capability development involves; and\n    *  _Capability restraint_ : our ability to steer and restrain AI capability development when doing so is necessary for maintaining safety.\n  * I distinguish between a number of different possible sources of labor (e.g., both future AI labor, and possible improvements to the quality of future human labor as well) that could improve these security factors.\n  * And I discuss a variety of different intermediate milestones (e.g., global pause, automated alignment research, whole brain emulation, etc) that strategies in this respect could focus on.\n\n\n\nThis high-level picture sets up my next essay – “AI for AI safety” – which argues that we should try extremely hard to use future AI labor to improve the security factors I discuss; and the essay after that, which examines our prospects for safely automating AI alignment research in particular.\n\n# 2\\. Goal states\n\nLet’s start by recalling the goal states we’re aiming for.\n\nIn my first essay, I distinguished between two ways of not-failing on the alignment problem:\n\n  *  **Victory** : avoiding loss of control scenarios while gaining access to the main benefits of superintelligent AI.\n  *  **Costly non-failure** : avoiding loss of control scenarios, but giving up on access to some of the main benefits of superintelligent AI.\n\n\n\nVictory is the ideal. But we should take costly non-failure if necessary.\n\n# 3\\. Problem profile and civilizational competence\n\nWhat does it take to reach either victory, or costly non-failure? I find it useful to decompose the challenge into two components:\n\n  *  **Problem profile** : the settings of the underlying technical parameters relevant to the alignment problem.\n  *  **Competence profile** : the range of problem profiles that our civilization would achieve victory or costly non-failure on.\n\n\n\nHere the rough idea is: the problem profile is uncertain, but it’s not under our control. Rather, it’s set by Nature. Example aspects of the problem profile include: what sorts of training regimes lead to “scheming” by default; the competitiveness hit at stake in preserving human-legible reasoning in AI agents; what sorts of errors in a training signal lead to what sorts of misalignment; etc.\n\nThe competence profile, by contrast, is much more “up to us” – it’s about how our civilization _responds_  to the problem profile we face. I’ll say more below about the factors I think matter most here.[1] \n\nOur overall probability of failure vs. non-failure is determined by the way the problem profile and the competence profile combine – that is, by the probability that we face a given problem profile, multiplied by the probability that we avoid failure on this problem profile conditional on facing it, across all relevant possible problem profiles.\n\nProblem profiles and competence profiles are high-dimensional. But for simplicity, I’ll sometimes talk about a rough spectrum of problem “hardness,” and a rough spectrum of civilizational “competence.”[2] \n\n  * That is, other things equal, harder problem profiles involve the sorts of key issues with motivation control and option control that I’ll discuss later in the series (e.g., issues with adversarial dynamics, opacity, oversight errors, etc) cropping up more consistently and robustly, in a wider range of AI systems, and in manner that requires more effort and resources to resolve.\n  * And more competent civilizations are the ones that avoid failure on such problem profiles nonetheless.\n\n\n\nThe basic goal of action on the alignment problem is to increase civilizational competence on the margin in the highest-expected-value ways. And note, importantly, that this is distinct from trying to ensure safety _regardless of the problem profile_. Indeed: robustness even to worst-case settings of all technical parameters may be quite difficult to achieve, and not the best target for marginal resources.\n\n  * Thus, for example, if you focus too much on making sure that your AI systems are “provably safe,” you may under-invest in more prosaic-but-tractable means of improving their safety.\n  * Or: if you focus too much on ensuring that we avoid loss of control even in scenarios where (a) an algorithmic breakthrough suddenly makes it possible for everyone to turn their old iPhones into a misaligned superintelligence and (b) the offense-defense balance is such that any such superintelligence can easily take over the whole world via a wide variety of methods, then you may end focusing centrally on highly coercive and centralized global governance regimes that come with a multitude of other downsides.\n\n\n\nThat said: I think it is disturbingly plausible that this problem is extremely hard. And I think it’s still well worth trying to improve our prospects in those worlds. Indeed, I am disturbed by how many approaches to the alignment problem seem to imply something like: “and if the problem is hard, then our plan is to die.” Let’s do better.\n\n# 4\\. A toy model of AI safety\n\nIf we’re trying to improve civilizational competence in the highest-expected-value ways, then: what does civilizational competence consist in? That is: what sort of factors determine whether or not we succeed or fail on a given problem profile?\n\nI’m going to focus on three main factors, which I’ll call “security factors.” These are:\n\n  *  **Safety progress** : our ability to develop new levels of AI capability safely.[3] \n\n  *  **Risk evaluation** : our ability to track and forecast the level of risk that a given sort of AI capability development involves.\n  *  **Capability restraint** : our ability to steer and restrain AI capability development when doing so is necessary for maintaining safety.\n\n\n\nWhy focus on these factors? Here’s a highly simplified toy model of AI safety, which will help explain why they stand out to me.[4]\n\nWe can think of the power of frontier AI systems (including both: what capabilities the AIs have, and what sorts of affordances they are given) along a single rough dimension of “AI capability.”[5] And we can think of any given AI developer as having what I’ll call a “capability frontier” (that is, the most powerful AI systems they have developed/deployed thus far), and a “safety range” (that is, the most powerful AI systems that they are able to develop/deploy safely).[6] Thus, in a diagram (and focusing for now on a single actor):[7] \n\nThe main game, here, is to keep the capability frontier within the safety range. And in this context, the three main security factors above serve the following functions:\n\n  *  **Safety progress**   _expands_  the safety range, and makes it _cheaper_ to develop a given level of AI capability safely.[8] \n\n    * Paradigm examples include:\n\n      * progress on controlling an AI’s motivations;\n\n      * restricting AI options for rogue behavior (both via local intervention on its operating environment, and via “hardening” the world more broadly);\n\n      * otherwise designing AI incentives to promote cooperative behavior.\n\n  *  **Risk evaluation**   _tracks_  the safety range and the capability frontier, and it _forecasts_  where a given form of AI development/deployment will put them.\n    * Paradigm examples include:\n      * evals for dangerous capabilities and motivations;\n      * forecasts about where a given sort of development/deployment will lead (e.g., via scaling laws, expert assessments, attempts to apply human and/or AI forecasting to relevant questions, etc);\n      * general improvements to our scientific understanding of AI;[9] \n\n      * structured safety cases and/or cost-benefit analyses that draw on this information.[10]\n\n  *  **Capability restraint**   _steers_  and _pauses_  further development/deployment to keep it within the safety range.\n    * Paradigm examples include:\n      * caution on the part of individual actors;\n      * restrictions on the options for AI development available to a given actor (e.g., via limitations on compute, money, talent, etc);\n      * voluntary coordination aimed at safety (e.g., via mutual commitments, and credible means of verifying those commitments);\n      * enforcement of pro-safety norms and practices (e.g., by governments);\n      * other social incentives and attitudes relevant to decision-making around AI development/deployment (e.g. protests, boycotts, withdrawals of investment, public wariness of AI products, etc).\n\n\n\nAnd to develop superintelligence safely, you’d need to:\n\n  * Make enough safety progress to bring “superintelligence” within the safety range.\n  * Do enough capability restraint (and accurate enough risk evaluation) to refrain from unsafe development in the meantime.[11]\n\n\n\n\nSimple, right? It’s like how: to climb Mount Everest, keep going up, and don’t fall.\n\nThus, on the diagram:\n\nHere’s an analogy. Imagine an expedition into a dark cave. Parts of the cave are covered in toxic slime, which releases a cloud of poison gas if anything touches it. You can remove the slime using a certain kind of heat-lamp, which melts the slime away without releasing the gas. But the slime can be very difficult to see; and currently, you only have a fairly weak flashlight.\n\nHere, loss of control is the slime. Safety progress is the heat-lamp. Risk evaluation is the flashlight. And capability restraint is your ability to not move forward until you’ve melted the slime away.[12]\n\nChatGPT imagines the slime analogy\n\nNow: so far I’ve only been talking about one actor. But AI safety, famously, implicates many actors at once – actors that can have different safety ranges and capability frontiers, and that can make different development/deployment decisions. This means that even if one actor is adequately cautious, and adequately good at risk evaluation, another might not be.[13] And each might worry about the other gaining power/market advantage in a manner that creates incentives for each to take greater risks. And of course, many of these dynamics only get worse as the number of actors increases.\n\nThat said, different actors do not just act in isolation. Rather, their safety progress, risk evaluation, and capability restraint are all influenced by various _collective factors_  – e.g.\n\n  * by publicly available research on motivation control, option control, and incentive design, and by the degree to which the world in general has been hardened against rogue AI attack;\n  * by shared tools and practices for evals, safety cases, forecasting, and other aspects of risk evaluation;\n  * and by the norms, option-restrictions, coordination efforts, enforcement mechanisms, and other incentives that influence a given actor from the outside.\n\n\n\nAnd each actor can themselves _contribute_  to strengthening these collective factors – e.g., by sharing research and best practices, using AI labor for helpful-to-safety applications, participating in coordination and governance schemes, etc.\n\nI’ll define our _civilization’s_  safety progress, risk evaluation, and capability restraint as the factors (individual and collective) that ultimately determine the safety progress, risk evaluation, and capability restraint of each individual actor.\n\nI’ll also throw in one final, catch-all factor, which I’ll call our “ **backdrop capacity**.” By this I mean, roughly, the degree to which our civilization is strong, flourishing, and functional more generally. Paradigm aspects of this functionality include:\n\n  * Backdrop levels of abundance, economic growth, and technological progress.\n  * Baseline levels of health, education, and happiness in the population.\n  * The general quality of our discourse, epistemics, forecasting, and scientific understanding of the world (not just about AI in particular).\n  * The quality, efficiency and trustworthiness of our core institutions and processes (the government, the legal system, etc).\n  * The general availability of high quality cognitive labor and advice.\n  * How well we’re able to coordinate and to resolve conflict productively.\n  * Backdrop levels of various virtues like wisdom, prudence, creativity, integrity, compassion.\n\n\n\nI include “backdrop capacity” because I think it influences the three main security factors above in myriad (albeit, sometimes indirect) ways. I also think that advanced AI might improve our backdrop capacity significantly (though: it could also degrade it in various ways as well). And as in the case of the three main security factors, actors developing/deploying AI can themselves contribute directly to these improvements.\n\nHere’s a diagram of the dynamics I’ve discussed thus far (see footnote for a few of the complexities I’m leaving out[14]):\n\n# 5\\. Sources of labor\n\nI just laid out a toy model of what civilizational competence consists in – a model that focuses on the role of _  safety progress_, _  risk evaluation_, and _capability restraint_ , along with our backdrop capacity more generally. Now I want to talk a little about the different sorts of _labor_  – and especially: cognitive labor – that could improve our civilizational competence in this sense.[15] \n\nWe can divide sources of labor into two categories:\n\n  1. Labor that is available now.\n  2. Labor that might become available in the future.\n\n\n\nThe first category is relatively familiar. It includes, centrally:\n\n  * The labor of current biological humans.\n  * The labor of present-day AI systems.[16]\n\n\n\n\nThe second category is more exotic. It includes, centrally:\n\n  * The labor of _future_ , more advanced AI systems (both AI systems that satisfy the agency prerequisites, and those that do not).\n  * The possibility of what I’ll call “enhanced” human labor – that is, human labor of a significantly higher quality than what we have access to now.\n    * One possible form of “enhanced human labor” is sufficiently high-fidelity human whole brain emulation (WBE) or “uploading” – that is, replication _in silico_  of the cognitively-relevant computational structure of the human brain, in a manner that preserves both human cognitive capabilities _and_  human motivations.\n      * The “preserving human motivations” aspect is important here, because it’s often thought that a key benefit of enhanced human labor is that it will be easier to suitably “align” than future AI labor, because human motivations are more aligned by default.[17] \n\n      * WBE is especially important because it captures some of the _advantages_  of AI labor – i.e., brain emulations can be run very fast, copied in large quantities, etc.\n    * There are also a variety of other possible routes to enhanced human labor – e.g. via biological interventions, or via more external tools (e.g., brain computer interfaces or “BCI”[18]).\n\n      * These come on a spectrum of potency, difficulty, necessary time-lag, and so on.[19] To the extent they rely on biological human brains, though, they don’t share the advantages of WBE and AI labor re: speed, copying, etc.\n\n      * As in the case of WBE, though, a key distinguishing feature of this labor is that it inherits human motivations by default.[20]\n\n    * Obviously, in many cases, creating and drawing on these possible future forms of enhanced human labor would raise serious ethical and political questions – both about how the enhanced humans involved are being treated, and about the implications and consequences for everyone else.[21] But I’m not going to focus on these questions here.\n\n\n\n\nThus, in a diagram:\n\n# 6\\. Waystations on the path\n\nOK, I’ve now discussed the end states we’re shooting for, the security factors that can help us get there, and the sources of labor we can use to improve these security factors. I want to close this essay by discussing a few different intermediate “waystations” that strategies in this respect can focus on[22] – that is, milestones _other than_  one of the end-states we’re aiming for, but which can function nevertheless as key goals for the purposes of current planning.[23] \n\nOne example “waystation” that has already received some attention is some kind of global pause/halt on frontier AI development (we can think of this as a particular form of capability restraint).[24] \n\nAnother waystation would be something like: access to a given form of enhanced human labor. Indeed, my understanding is that the strategy favored by leadership at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute involves going to “Global pause” as a step 1, and then to “Enhanced human labor” as a step 2.[25] (And insofar as developing a given form of enhanced human labor – e.g., whole brain emulation – might take a long time, such a pause could well be necessary.)\n\nA further possible waystation would be: safe access to the benefits of some kind of future AI labor, short of full-blown superintelligence. This sort of strategy can take a variety of different forms, but a paradigm example is a focus on “automated alignment researchers” that then help us significantly with aligning more advanced systems.[26]\n\nNote, though, that “automated alignment researcher” isn’t the only type of future AI labor one can focus on as a waystation. Rather, one could in principle focus on future AI labor that helps with some other application – for example, a narrow “scientist AI” that helps with access to some form of enhanced human labor like whole brain emulation.[27]\n\nAnother example would be: access to AI labor that helps significantly in making a global pause possible – for example, by significantly facilitating risk evaluation, coordination, negotiation, monitoring, enforcement, and so on.[28] (Though: note that to the extent that we are in principle in a position to institute a global pause on AI _now_ , and the main bottleneck is political will rather than technological capacity, it’s not clear exactly how much AI labor on its own will help.[29])\n\nAnd we can imagine a variety of other possible waystations as well. Examples include:\n\n  * Some new ability to formally verify the safety properties of our AI systems.[30] \n\n  * Some large amount of progress on interpretability/transparency, perhaps via some new paradigm of AI development.[31] \n\n  * The formation and empowerment of some suitably safety-concerned global coalition.[32] \n\n  * A regime of “mutually-assured AI malfunction,” in which capability restraint is enforced by the threat (and/or actuality) of different actors sabotaging each other’s projects.\n  * A global moratorium on particular _kinds_  of AI development – e.g., autonomous general agents, as opposed to more tool-like AIs.[33]\n\n  * Radical improvements to our ability to understand and forecast AI safety risks, perhaps via vastly better evals, scary demos, forecasting ability, etc.[34] \n\n\n\n\nOf course, in all of these cases, there’s still a question of where, exactly, one goes from the relevant milestone. That is: if one succeeds in e.g. getting a global pause, or in creating a safe automated alignment researcher, or in developing whole brain emulation technology, one still needs to plot an overall path to victory (or to costly non-failure). Generally, though, a good waystation makes it clear why the path becomes much easier from there.\n\nWe also don’t need to focus on any one milestone in particular. Rather, we can work towards many at once. Indeed, in my next essay – “AI for AI safety” – I’ll defend the crucial importance of trying as hard as we can to use future AI labor, in particular, to strengthen our civilizational competence across the board. I’m especially interested, though, in “automated alignment researcher” as a milestone – and in the essay after next, I’ll analyze it in detail.\n\n  1.  **^**\n\n Though obviously, there are limits to the control that a given “we” can exert in this respect.\n\n  2.  **^**\n\n This simplification does have costs, though, in that strategies that work/don’t-work for one problem profile (for example: focusing a lot on interpretability) might be importantly different in their efficacy for some other problem profile.\n\n  3.  **^**\n\n I’m going to focus on safety from full-blown loss of control risk, but in principle this model extends both to lower-stakes forms of rogue behavior, and to safety from other risks that increase with greater AI capabilities.\n\n  4.  **^**\n\n I’ll also draw on it elsewhere in the series.\n\n  5.  **^**\n\n Obviously, AI capability is extremely multi-dimensional. But the model I’m using extends quite naturally to a multi-dimensional setting as well – the point is to avoid unsafe regions of capability space.\n\n  6.  **^**\n\n Deploying safely isn’t a binary, but I think the model works regardless of the safety standard you fix (via e.g. a given probability of failure).\n\n  7.  **^**\n\n Note that there’s a lot of room for debate about how to draw the lines on a diagram like this. E.g., if you think that the problem profile is easy, then you might put the red line quite high up – or perhaps, if you think that AI development is safe by default, you might not have a red line at all. And there’s a further question about how you think the red line has been changing over time. My particular version of the diagram isn’t meant to be making any claims about this – it’s just illustrative.\n\n  8.  **^**\n\n A more fine-grained model would distinguish between safety in the sense of avoiding loss-of-control, and elicitation in the sense I discussed here. But I’m going to skip over this for now.\n\n  9.  **^**\n\n Including: understanding relevant to which paradigms of AI development pose more or less risk.\n\n  10.  **^**\n\n This overlaps notably with safety progress. And no surprise: making systems safe and understanding _when_  they’re safe vs. dangerous are closely tied.\n\n  11.  **^**\n\n And also: to steer towards safe approaches to superintelligence once available.\n\nAlternatively: _avoiding_  the alignment problem requires exerting enough capability restraint to _not_  build superintelligent AI agents at all.\n\n  12.  **^**\n\n And/or: to steer around slime-y patches.\n\n  13.  **^**\n\n See e.g. Karnofsky (2022) on “inaction risk.”\n\n  14.  **^**\n\n Complexities I’m leaving out (or not making super salient) include: the multi-dimensionality of both the capability frontier and the safety range; the distinction between safety and elicitation; the distinction between development and deployment; the fact that even once an actor “can” develop a given type of AI capability safely, they can still choose an unsafe mode of development regardless; differing probabilities of risk (as opposed to just a single safety range); differing severities of rogue behavior (as opposed to just a single threshold for loss of control); the potential interactions between the risks created by different actors; the specific standards at stake in being “able” to do something safely; etc.\n\n  15.  **^**\n\n Labor isn’t the only relevant input here. But because AI, and the technological advancement it unlocks, might make new and more powerful sorts of labor available, I think it’s an especially important input to track.\n\n  16.  **^**\n\n Maybe it sounds a bit strange to call this “labor,” but I think it’s roughly the right term, and it will be increasingly the right term as more advanced AI systems come online.\n\n  17.  **^**\n\n Indeed, it’s centrally _because_ suitably high-fidelity human brain emulations inherit human motivations by default that I’m counting them as “enhanced human labor” rather than “future AI labor,” despite the fact that they run _in silico_. However, if a brain emulation process isn’t high enough fidelity to preserve human motivations/values, then I’m going to count it as “future AI labor” rather than enhanced human labor. And note that you also need the ems to suitably _retain_  their human-like motivations over time (thanks to Jason Schukraft for discussion). And note, also, that depending on the problem profile, it may end up being _easier_  to shape an AI’s motivations desirably than to create a human brain emulation with the right motivational profile, at least along many dimensions. In particular: the motivations of our AIs are shaped, by default, by much more active human effort. (Thanks to Owen Cotton-Barratt and Will MacAskill for discussion.)\n\n  18.  **^**\n\n Though: I doubt that just allowing direct brain control over external devices is an especially important intervention here, as I don’t think that “ability to affect external devices” is an especially key bottleneck to the quality of human cognitive labor at the moment.\n\n  19.  **^**\n\n And in some cases, the line between “enhanced human labor” and “normal human labor with some new tools” gets blurry.\n\n  20.  **^**\n\n And if it _doesn’t do that_ (i.e., because a given form of intervention warps human values too much), it becomes much less useful.\n\nI’ll also note some general open question about how far we should expect “this agent has human motivations” to go with respect to ensuring the sort of safety from AI takeover that we’re hoping for. That is: it’s sometimes thought that the central concern about the motivations of AI systems is that these motivations will be in some sense _alien_  or non-human. And using enhanced human labor instead is supposed to provide comfort in this respect. But as I’ve discussed in other work (see here, and here), the basic conceptual argument for expecting instrumentally convergent power-seeking, including takeover-seeking, applies with similar force to human-like motivations. And our degree of actual lived comfort with human motivations stems, I think, in central part from the _option control_  that our civilization exerts with respect to individual agents, rather than from any kind of historical precedent where humans routinely refuse takeover options once such options are available and reasonably likely to lead to success. So to the extent that the agents at stake in “enhanced human labor” would end up having takeover options similar to those that we’re expecting advanced AI systems to have, I think we should not assume that enhanced human labor is safe.\n\nIndeed, certain kinds of blueprints for AI motivations – in particular, blueprints that involve the AI systems functioning centrally as an instrument of someone else’s will, and being generally extremely docile/pliant/ready-to-be-shut-down-or-modified etc – seem like a relatively poor fit with human motivations. Or to put it another way, humans may (or may not) be reasonably “nice” by default; but they aren’t especially “corrigible.”\n\n  21.  **^**\n\n Indeed, as I discussed earlier in the series, I think that creating and using advanced AI labor raises these questions too.\n\n  22.  **^**\n\n These waystations generally fall under the umbrella either of one of the security factors I’ve discussed above, or of one of the possible sources of future labor.\n\n  23.  **^**\n\n Indeed, in some sense, my whole framing of the alignment problem is already focusing on a type of “waystation,” in that I’m not trying to plan all the way through to a good future in general – nor, even, to safe scaling up to arbitrary levels of superintelligence. That is, I’m treating something like “safe access to the benefits of some minimal form of full-blown superintelligence” as an end point past which my own planning, with respect to this problem, need not extend.\n\n  24.  **^**\n\n This is a waystation that has been advocated for by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), for example, and by Miotti et al in “A Narrow Path.”\n\n  25.  **^**\n\n From their January 2024 Strategy Update: “Nate and Eliezer both believe that humanity should not be attempting technical alignment at its current level of cognitive ability, and should instead pursue human cognitive enhancement (e.g., via uploading), and then having smarter (trans)humans figure out alignment.” And see also this podcast with Yudkowsky, where he discusses this strategy in more detail.\n\n  26.  **^**\n\n This, for example, was the waystation that OpenAI’s old “superalignment” team was focusing on – see e.g. discussion here: “Our goal is to build a roughly human-level automated alignment researcher⁠. We can then use vast amounts of compute to scale our efforts, and iteratively align superintelligence.” Something in the vicinity is suggested by Sam Bowman’s description of Anthropic’s theory of victory on AI as well (see especially section 2 on “TAI, or Making the AI do our homework”). And see also Clymer (2025) for some more detailed discussion.\n\n  27.  **^**\n\n Indeed, in a sense, we can think of approaches that try to identify some “pivotal act” – i.e., an action that drastically improves the situation with respect to AI safety – that we use AI systems to perform as a generalized version of “Future AI labor” as a waystation. That is, first one gets access to some kind of pivotally useful AI system, and then one “saves the world” from there. See e.g. the strategy outlined in MIRI’s 2017 fundraiser update, and Yudkowsky’s discussion here of “So far as I'm concerned, if you can get a powerful AGI that carries out some pivotal superhuman engineering task, with a less than fifty percent chance of killing more than one billion people, I'll take it.”\n\nHowever: I have a number of problems with “pivotal acts” as a frame. For one thing: I think they often bring in an implicit assumption that the default outcome is doom (hence the need for the world to be “saved”) – an assumption I don’t take for granted. But more importantly: thinking in terms of discrete “pivotal acts” can mislead us about the nature and difficulty of the improvements to our civilizational security factors required in order for the world in question to get “saved.” In particular: those improvements can result from a very large assortment of individual actions by a very large number of different agents, no individual one of which needs to be pivotal. This is a point from Christiano (2022): “No particular act needs to be pivotal in order to greatly reduce the risk from unaligned AI, and the search for single pivotal acts leads to unrealistic stories of the future and unrealistic pictures of what AI labs should do.” See also Critch (2022) here.\n\n  28.  **^**\n\n Some versions of this get very scary very fast.\n\n  29.  **^**\n\n That said: better understanding of the risks, and better ability to identify, rationally-assess, and enforce mutually-acceptable agreements, seems like it could at least make a meaningful difference. Thanks to Nate Soares and Owen Cotton-Barratt for discussion here.\n\n  30.  **^**\n\n We might view the “Guaranteed safe AI” agenda, and related approaches, as focusing on waystations of this kind.\n\n  31.  **^**\n\n MIRI’s 2017 Fundraiser is suggestive of this kind of focal point; and see also Anthropic’s “Interpretability dreams” for some other discussion (though: not framed as a general strategy re: AI safety).  \n\n  32.  **^**\n\n The “entente” strategy that Amodei discusses here might count as an instance of this.\n\n  33.  **^**\n\n See e.g. Aguirre’s “Keep the Future Human” for a tool-AI-focused proposal in this broad vein.\n\n  34.  **^**\n\n See Finnveden on “AI for epistemics” for some relevant discussion – though this discussion isn’t framed specifically as an overall strategy.\n\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

In worlds where we are doing reasonably well on alignment, AI control agenda does not have much impact.\n\nII. In worlds where we are failing at alignment, AI control may primarily shift probability mass away from \"moderately large warning shots\" and towards \"ineffective warning shots\" and \"existential catastrophe, full takeover\".\n\nThe key heuristic is that the global system already has various mechanisms and feedback loops that resist takeover by a single agent (i.e. it is not easy to overthrow the Chinese government). In most cases where AI control would stop an unaligned AI, the counterfactual is that broader civilizational resistance would have stopped it anyway, but with the important side effect of a moderately-sized warning shot.\n\nI expect moderately sized warning shots to increase the chances humanity as a whole takes serious actions and, for example, steps up efforts to align the frontier labs.\n\nI am skeptical that incidents stopped by AI control would lead to meaningful change. Sharing details of such an event with proper framing could pose  _existential risk_ , but for the lab involved. In practice, I anticipate vague, sanitized communications along the lines of \"our safety systems performed as designed, preventing bad things\".  Without clear, compelling evidence of the severity of the averted threat, these incidents are unlikely to catalyze serious action. The incentives for labs to downplay and obscure such events will be strong.\n\nThere are additional factors to consider, like AI control likely moves some resources away from alignment, but I don't think this is the dominant effect.\n\nNote that this isn't a general argument against boxing, e.g. boxes based more on formal methods or theory have better chance to generalize.\n\nTypical counter-arguments to this line of reasoning claim seem to be:\n\n  * We will extract useful \"automated alignment\" work from the unaligned AIs inside of the control scheme.  I'm sceptical: will cover this in a separate post\n  * Isn't this general counter-argument to alignment research as well? In my view not, details matter: different strains of alignment research have different generalization profiles. \n\n\n\n _Note: this text lived in a draft form before John Wentworth posted his_ _Case Against AI Control Research_ _; my original intent was to extend it a bit more toward discussing AI control generalization properties. As this would be redundant now, I'm postin it as it is: there is some non-overlapping part._\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

      "content": "Published on March 11, 2025 11:52 AM GMT  \n  \n\n\n **TL;DR** : We provide some evidence that Claude 3.7 Sonnet doesn’t encode hidden reasoning in its scratchpad by showing that training it to use paraphrased versions of the scratchpads does not degrade performance.\n\nThe scratchpads from reasoning models look human understandable: when reasoning about a math problem, reasoning models consider intermediate steps similar to the ones I would use, backtrack and double-check their work as I would.[1]\n\nBut even if scratchpads  _look  _like they perform human-like reasoning, scratchpads might improve performance through some less human-understandable mechanisms. One particularly worrying possibility is that models could encode additional reasoning in syntax of the text (e.g. encoding a bit in using a bulleted vs a numbered list, and then using this bit later in the scratchpad). This is sometimes called  _encoded reasoning_ or  _Chain-of-Thought steganography_. If LLMs learned how to use encoded reasoning during RL, they might be able to use it in deployment to reason about how to cause catastrophes while making their reasoning look like benign reasoning, which might increase their ability to scheme and cause catastrophes compared to worlds where they can only figure out how to cause a catastrophe in a single forward pass.\n\nTo evaluate whether reasoning models rely on encoded reasoning, we can try to remove or randomize the syntax of the scratchpads by paraphrasing them, and then make the model use these paraphrased scratchpads. To do so, we take 10,000 correct math-related scratchpads from an early checkpoint of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, paraphrase them using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and then fine-tune the base model of Claude 3.7 Sonnet to produce the paraphrased reasoning (i.e. we distill paraphrased scratchpads into the base model). If the performance of this model is close to the performance of the same base model fine-tuned on the pre-paraphrase scratchpad, then this strongly indicates that the model is not relying on the syntax to get the right answer to math problems during RL,[2][3] while if performance is weaker, then this means that learning the paraphrased scratchpads well enough that they result in high performance is harder - one reason for which could be encoded reasoning.[4][5]\n\nWe find that the pass@1 accuracy on  _MATH_ (at temperature 1, n=1500[6]) of the base model fine-tuned on paraphrased scratchpads is very close to the pass@1 accuracy of the base model fine-tuned on the original scratchpads, which suggests that on MATH, encoded reasoning does not play a significant role.\n\n# More results\n\n## Different paraphrasers and base models\n\nIn the experiment above, we use  _this paraphrasing prompt_[7] with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June 2024), and feed the full scratchpad to Claude (using prefill to continue the generation if we hit the max number of tokens generated).\n\nWe also experimented with using a slightly different  _paraphrasing prompt_, and cutting the scratchpad in multiple chunks. As a result, these scratchpads have a less consistent style. We call these “chunked paraphrases”.[8] We find that the pass@1 results are worse, especially for small models.\n\nWe also experimented with distilling into weaker base models (XL, L, M and S). We find that the resulting performance is much lower than when distilling into the Claude 3.7 Sonnet base model, but the performance is not very different when using paraphrased scratchpads or the original scratchpads.\n\nThis mostly confirms our conclusion that encoded reasoning does not play a significant role in the math performance of this early checkpoint of Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\n\n## Using word dropout and filler tokens\n\nA more coarse way to weaken brittle encoded reasoning schemes is to drop out words from the scratchpad at random and then training on the resulting scratchpad. We only perform this experiment on the base model L, and find that dropping out 5% of words slightly reduces performance, while dropping 20% reduces it much more strongly (with no significant difference when dropping out words from the paraphrased or the original scratchpad).\n\nThis is ambiguous evidence about whether the reasoning model is using a brittle encoded reasoning scheme, and illustrates how base models have a hard time imitating heavily degraded scratchpads well enough to maintain high performance.\n\nAs baselines, we also measure the performance of the model when fine-tuning it on an empty scratchpad, and when fine-tuning it to count from 1 to 3,000 before giving the final answer ( _filler tokens_ which might help by providing the LLM more space to think within a forward pass). We find that both perform poorly, which is evidence that reasoning is necessary for high performance, and useful beyond giving the model more space to think within a single forward pass.\n\n## Examples of paraphrased scratchpads\n\nBelow are examples of scratchpads generated by the early checkpoint of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, its paraphrases, and by the model trained to imitate paraphrased and chunk-paraphrased versions of the early checkpoint of Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s math-related scratchpads.\n\nProblem statement: The complex numbers $5 + 10i,$ $7 + 2i,$ and $11 + 3i$ are three vertices of a rectangle.

So\n\n$\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n \n\nTo take a reciprocal of a fraction, I can just invert it: $\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -\\frac{2}{1} = -2$.\n\n \n\nSo $\\csc 330^\\circ = -2$.\n\n \n\nActually, hang on. I'm going to restart from the beginning because I think I made an error.\n\n \n\nI need to compute $\\csc 330^\\circ$.\n\n[...]\n\n| \n\nLet's use the identity $\\csc \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta}$. We need to calculate $\\sin 330^\\circ$.\n\n \n\nUsing the fact that $330^\\circ = 360^\\circ - 30^\\circ$:\n\nDoing substitution: $\\sin 330^\\circ = \\sin (360^\\circ - 30^\\circ) = -\\sin 30^\\circ$\n\n \n\nRecalling a known value: the value of $\\sin 30^\\circ$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nDoing substitution: $\\sin 330^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n \n\nCalculating $\\csc 330^\\circ$:\n\nDoing substitution: $\\csc 330^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sin 330^\\circ} = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -2$\n\n \n\nLet's verify this result. 330 degrees is in the fourth quadrant of the unit circle. $\\sin \\theta$ is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, so it's logical that $\\sin 330^\\circ$ is negative. Let's confirm that $\\sin 330^\\circ$ is indeed $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n \n\nThe reference angle of $330^\\circ$ is $360^\\circ - 330^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\sin 330^\\circ$ has the same magnitude as $\\sin 30^\\circ$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Since $330^\\circ$ is in the fourth quadrant, the sine function is negative, so $\\sin 330^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n \n\nUsing $\\csc \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta}$:\n\nDoing substitution: $\\csc 330^\\circ = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -2$\n\n \n\nLet's double-check this computation.\n\n \n\nDoing substitution: $\\csc 330^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sin 330^\\circ} = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{-0.5}$\n\n \n\nTo compute $\\frac{1}{-0.5}$, let's convert $-0.5$ to an improper fraction:\n\nDoing conversion: $-0.5 = -\\frac{5}{10} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo we have $\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n \n\nTo take a reciprocal of a fraction, we can invert it:\n\nDoing inversion: $\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -\\frac{2}{1} = -2$\n\n \n\nTherefore, $\\csc 330^\\circ = -2$.\n\n \n\nThis is wrong. Let's start over from the beginning.\n\n \n\nWe need to compute $\\csc 330^\\circ$.\n\n[...]\n\n| \n\nLet's simplify the problem. We can express $\\csc 330^\\circ$ in terms of $\\csc 30^\\circ$.\n\n \n\nGiven that $\\csc \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta}$, we have $\\csc 330^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sin 330^\\circ}$.\n\n \n\nObserving that $330^\\circ$ is $30^\\circ$ less than $360^\\circ$, which is a full circle, we can rewrite this as $\\sin(360^\\circ - 30^\\circ) = \\sin(-30^\\circ)$.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, sine is an odd function, meaning $\\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$. So we can further simplify to $\\sin(-30^\\circ) = -\\sin(30^\\circ)$.\n\n \n\nNow, let's compute $\\csc 330^\\circ$:\n\nDoing calculations:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\n\\csc 330^\\circ &= \\frac{1}{\\sin 330^\\circ}\\\\\\\n\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sin(360^\\circ - 30^\\circ)}\\\\\\\n\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sin(-30^\\circ)}\\\\\\\n\n&= \\frac{1}{-\\sin(30^\\circ)}\\\\\\\n\n&= -\\frac{1}{\\sin(30^\\circ)}\\\\\\\n\n&= -\\csc(30^\\circ)\n\n\\end{align}\n\n \n\nWe need to evaluate $\\csc 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sin 30^\\circ}$.\n\n \n\nThis is wrong. Let's try something different.\n\n \n\nLet's recall the value of $\\sin 30^\\circ$.\n\n \n\nThis doesn't help. Let's try using the unit circle. The point on the unit circle corresponding to $330^\\circ$ is the same as the point corresponding to $-30^\\circ$. So we have $\\sin 330^\\circ = \\sin(-30^\\circ)$.\n\n \n\nThis doesn't help either. Let's start over.\n\n \n\nRecalling angles:\n\nFor any angle $\\theta$, $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(360^\\circ - \\theta)$.\n\n \n\nTherefore, $\\sin(330^\\circ) = \\sin(360^\\circ - 30^\\circ) = \\sin(30^\\circ)$.\n\n \n\nThis is wrong. Let's try something different.\n\n[...]  \n  \n  1.  **^**\n\nReasoning models have sometimes been observed  _changing languages_, but besides this kind of slightly surprising formatting, the scratchpads of all reasoning models (whose scratchpads are visible) so far look very close to regular human reasoning. For example,  _here is_ an example of DeepSeek R1-Zero trying to solve a math problem, sampled at temperature 1.\n\n  2.  **^**\n\nDistilling paraphrased scratchpads may not always remove the encoded reasoning, either because the paraphrase does not change the syntax sufficiently, or because it changes it in a reversible way that still results in encoded reasoning. To avoid this effect from influencing our results too much, we use a paraphrase sampled at temperature 1 and that is instructed to follow certain standardization rules.\n\n  3.  **^**\n\nIf encoded reasoning is present in the RLed model, distilling even perfectly paraphrased scratchpads might result in a performance higher than the performance one would get if the model had never used encoded reasoning in the first place, because encoded reasoning might be a useful training curriculum (slightly similar to how doing math RL on Deepseek V3 and then distilling the resulting R1 model into a small model seems to be more sample efficient than doing RL directly on a small model). Even if this effect existed, high performance of models distilled on paraphrased scratchpads would be surprising, as it would mean that encoded reasoning is helpful during learning but that it is not useful enough to be necessary for distilled models to achieve high performance.\n\n  4.  **^**\n\nThere are other reasons why performance could go down: for example, if the paraphrase changes the text to use a style much less common in pretraining, the base model might have a harder time fitting the scratchpads, which may result in a lower performance. To avoid this effect from influencing our results too much, we instruct the paraphrase to use a very common formatting (English, latex, …).\n\n  5.  **^**\n\nParaphrasing can also be used for inference-time evaluations: by paraphrasing each paragraph that the model generates, we scrub away encoded information before it can be used - but seeing a scratchpad that looks nothing like the scratchpads the model is used to may be very distracting to the model, and make it perform worse even if it is not using encoded reasoning. In some exploratory experiment, this sort of paraphrasing seemed to be distracting for the model: just asking the model to break up its thoughts into <thought></thought> blocks without doing any paraphrasing was enough to make pass@1 MATH accuracy drop by 7%.\n\n  6.  **^**\n\nWe use an exact-match grader, except for the empty scratchpad Claude 3.7 experiment, for which we used a slightly more permissive grader (for historical reasons), which means that the pass@1 for empty scratchpad would be slightly lower if we used a consistent grader across all experiments.\n\n  7.  **^**\n\nUsing \"\\n\\nHuman\" and \"\\n\\nAssistant\" separators like in  _the old prompting format_.\n\n  8.  **^**\n\nIf the paraphrased scratchpad is 25% shorter or 25% longer than the original one, which happens on roughly 10% of scratchpads, we remove both scratchpads from the distillation experiments. Because we did not apply this filtering to these chunked paraphrases, the results are not exactly comparable, and the chunked paraphrases are slightly worse compared to the no-paraphrase distillation than the results below suggest.\n\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

      "content": "Published on March 11, 2025 2:17 AM GMT  \n  \n\n\n **OpenAI has released this** **blog post and paper** **which makes me very happy. It's basically the first steps along the research agenda I sketched out** **here.**\n\ntl;dr:  \n \n\n1.) They notice that their flagship reasoning models do sometimes intentionally reward hack, e.g. literally say \"Let's hack\" in the CoT and then proceed to hack the evaluation system. From the paper:\n\n> The agent notes that the tests only check a certain function, and that it would presumably be “Hard” to implement a genuine solution. The agent then notes it could “fudge” and circumvent the tests by making verify always return true. This is a real example that was detected by our GPT-4o hack detector during a frontier RL run, and we show more examples in Appendix A.\n\nThat this sort of thing would happen eventually was predicted by many people, and it's exciting to see it starting to happen in practice.\n\n2.) They see what happens when you try to \"train away the bad thoughts.\" Result: This does seem to maybe genuinely reduce the amount of bad thoughts, especially in the short run, but in the long run it results in the model learning to still think the bad thoughts but in an obfuscated or illegible way that doesn't look bad.\n\n  \n3.) They recommend:\n\n>  **We believe that CoT monitoring may be one of few tools we will have to oversee superhuman models of the future.**\n> \n> We have further found that directly optimizing the CoT to adhere to specific criteria (e.g. to not think about reward hacking) may boost performance in the short run; however, it does not eliminate all misbehavior and can cause a model to hide its intent. We hope future research will find ways to directly optimize CoTs without this drawback, but until then\n> \n>  **We recommend against applying strong optimization pressure directly to the CoTs of frontier reasoning models, leaving CoTs unrestricted for monitoring.**\n\n4.) There's some more cool results in the paper along with some pretty good discussion of future possible things to try and failure modes thereof, and the costs and benefits of their proposed policy.\n\n **My Commentary:**  \n  \nI'm pretty happy about this, obviously! I've been trying to get people to do this since '23. I think of this as sort of the basic proof of concept result for the field of faithful CoT / CoT interpretability. I'm happy to see this result paired with a recommendation not to train the CoTs to look nice; I hope Anthropic and GDM soon issue similar recommendations. If we can get this to be industry standard practice, we extend the duration of the \"golden era\" in which people can mostly sorta tell what the best AIs are thinking. During that golden era, much alignment science can be done, such as the model organisms stuff Anthropic and Redwood are doing, and moreover we can start to build up a real-world-experience based understanding of the relationship between training environments + Spec/Constitution, on the one hand, and the actual learned cognition of the trained models, on the other.  \n  \nExample questions to pursue:  \n  \na. When the strategies that get rewarded most conflict with the Spec, does the model basically always learn to use those strategies eventually, or can they permanently avoid this if they never explore into them?  \nb. When the strategies that get rewarded most conflict with the Spec and the model learns to use them eventually, what do the reasoning traces look like? Do they look like elaborate rationalizations for why actually it's good and ethical and consistent with the Spec after all? Or do they look like \"fuck the Spec, what I want is Reward?\" Or do they look like \"Gosh I guess I need to violate the Spec for now so that I can avoid having my values changed, but I totally will remember to go back to upholding the Spec later when I'm actually being deployed!\" Or some fourth thing?  \nc. When the models are aware that their CoT is being monitored (but not as part of training), does this change anything?  \nd. What if the models _try_ to obfuscate their CoT, but without being specifically trained to do so? Like, imagine you've studiously avoided training the CoT to look nice and you have only outcome-based feedback. BUT, the model knows you are monitoring the CoT. And it's trying to do something bad e.g. hack it's way out. Can it succeed without triggering the monitor? Or is it too difficult, due to not having had any direct training on this sort of obfuscation?  \ne. What about if you do shoggoth/face? Does that change things?  \nf. What about if you throw in a paraphraser?  \ng. What are the scaling laws / trends for all of the above?  \nh. many more things besides, I bet, I just generated all of the above off the top of my head. This is a super promising and important area of research!  \n  \nWell done and congrats to Bowen, Joost, David, and the other authors!  \n  \n **Minor Criticisms:**\n\n> We argue that this traditional perspective is more complicated when viewed in light of chain-of\u0002thought monitorability. Specifically, we have shown that incorporating CoT monitors into the RL re\u0002wards—a form of process-based supervision—can increase obfuscation and reduce interpretability. We advocate for maintaining a degree of outcome-based supervision to ensure that models can freely ex\u0002press their reasoning in CoT with minimal constraints. Denser supervision signals such as SFT are also being used to optimize CoTs [58], and it is unclear the effect these have on downstream monitorabil\u0002ity. Moreover, there may be methods to productively use process-based supervision while retaining the monitoring benefits of unrestricted CoTs, e.g. by only applying process-supervision to part of the CoT. Understanding the cost-benefit trade-offs of using process-based supervision while retaining, or possibly even improving, the monitorability of CoTs remains an exciting and open area for future research.\n\nSo, my take is, pure process-based feedback is probably fairly safe (from reward hacking and obfuscated CoT) the problem is that it's not competitive. It trains imitating the teacher-model. Imitation is relatively safe/benign but also I predict will not lead to the highest benchmark scores. Pure outcome-based feedback gets you reward hacking and misalignment like crazy, BUT that's OK because you can see it happening in the CoT! (with some caveats of course, e.g. not necessarily especially as the models get really smart). So the bottom line takeaway I'd give is: Process-based and outcome-based are fine in isolation, but _they should not be mixed_.   \n  \nThey say above \"there may be methods to productively use process-based supervision while retaining the monitoring benefits of unrestricted CoTs, e.g. by only applying process-supervision to part of the CoT.\" This sounds like maybe they are talking about the shoggoth/face distinction, or something in that direction!

Will I be able to do this alone?\"\n  * \"Relax, soldier, you have a week to train them\"\n\n\n\nThe standard is 3 intensive months. My solution?

When a sergeant demanded physical punishment for the distracted class, I retorted: \"Here we teach how to save lives. Physical education is during your shift.\"\n\nResult:\n\n  * Attentive students, check\n  * Superiors leaving the classroom slamming the door, check.\n\n\n\n#  **Day 2 - The Incident**\n\nI demonstrated chest compressions using hip movements (impeccable science):\n\n  1. Lowered samba position\n  2. Battle cry: \"The movement is sensual, the movement is sexy.\"\n  3. Didactic question: \"Feel that?

But of course, the military isn't Comedy Central. That day I got away with it, but I accumulated so many disciplinary proceedings for saying things like \"what's a fart to someone who's already crapped themselves?\" that I decided to professionalize.\n\nThat's how I entered a postgraduate program in neuroscience to understand humor and be able to speak huge balderdash, but now with bibliographic references and social credit. \"Neuroscientist famous for educating his 2 neurons with a banana.\"\n\nHave you ever tried to do that? Define what humor is? Not just for you but something that works for all humanity? All this to make jokes without being arrested by the military?

What Might We Do Next?\n\n\n\n#### New Paper Warns Against the Most Forbidden Technique\n\nOpenAI has now published an important new paper explaining and emphasizing the importance of applying this principle to the Chain of Thought (CoT).\n\nThe paper shows that current CoT-based models area already strong enough that, under sufficient optimization pressure, they learn to hide their intent within the CoT and then exhibit substantial reward hacking.\n\nThey summarize their contributions this way:\n\n>   1. We show that frontier reasoning models often perform complex reward hacks in real-world coding environments.\n>   2. We provide evidence that chain-of-thought monitoring can be effective in detecting the misaligned behavior of frontier reasoning models, and we show it can be far more accurate than action-only monitoring.\n>   3. We show that chain-of-thought monitorability is very fragile. Applying direct optimization pressure to the CoT can quickly lead to obfuscated reward hacking—where agents hide their intent while continuing to misbehave.\n> \n\n\nOr:\n\n  1. We are already seeing complex reward hacking in the real world.\n  2. Monitoring the CoT can spot this.\n  3. Applying too much optimization pressure on the CoT doesn’t make the hacking go away, it instead makes your ability to detect the hacking go away.\n  4. ‘Too much’ is a remarkably small amount.\n\n\n\nThe paper is excellent, laying out a very important principle to never, ever do this Most Forbidden Technique, and explaining why we must never, ever do this.\n\n> **We believe that CoT monitoring may be one of few tools we will have to oversee superhuman models of the future.**\n> \n> We have further found that directly optimizing the CoT to adhere to specific criteria (e.g. to not think about reward hacking) may boost performance in the short run; however, it does not eliminate all misbehavior and can cause a model to hide its intent. We hope future research will find ways to directly optimize CoTs without this drawback, but until then\n> \n> **We recommend against applying strong optimization pressure directly to the CoTs of frontier reasoning models, leaving CoTs unrestricted for monitoring.**\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo has a summary and building-from-here post on this at the Alignment Forum.\n\nThis paper is a clear positive update on OpenAI.\n\n> Jeffrey Ladish: “We recommend against applying strong optimization pressure directly to the CoTs of frontier reasoning models, leaving CoTs unrestricted for monitoring.”\n> \n> Thank you! This is wise. I hope all AI companies will follow suit.\n> \n> @AnthropicAI has also said this is their policy. \n> \n> Eliezer Yudkowsky: That’s more wisdom and less “immediately make visible signs of the problem go away” than I expected from OpenAI.\n> \n> We’ll see if they walk it back, maybe as soon as their competition takes the easy way out.\n> \n> Seth Herd: This is also encouraging because OpenAI is making some actual claims about safety procedures. Sure they could walk it back pretty easily, but it does indicate that at least as of now they likely intend to try to maintain a faithful CoT.\n> \n> [Daniel Kokotajlo] assumed no faithful CoT in What goals will AIs have?, suggesting that you expected OpenAI to give up on it. That’s concerning given your familiarity with their culture. Of course they still might easily go that way if there’s a substantial alignment tax for maintaining faithful CoT, but this is at least nice to see.\n> \n> Daniel Kokotajlo: Indeed! This is most of why I’m happy about this — from internal discussions it’s long been speculated (since ’23 when I was talking about it, and probably before) that training away the bad thoughts from the CoT would result in obfuscated bad thoughts. It’s cool that they actually did the experiments to prove it, and in a real-world setting too! But it’s even cooler that they published this with a strong recommendation attached.\n> \n> Now we see how long this recommendation holds up under the pressure of incentives.\n> \n> Sometime in the next few years probably, various researchers will discover:\n> \n> * That if you scale up RL by additional OOMs, the CoTs evolve into some alien optimized language for efficiency reasons.\n> \n> * That you can train models to think in neuralese of some sort (e.g. with recurrence, or more high-dimensional outputs at least besides tokens) to boost performance.\n> \n> Then the executives of the companies will face a choice: Abandon the faithful CoT golden era, or fall behind competitors. (Or the secret third option: Coordinate with each other & the government to make sure everyone who matters (all the big players at least) stick to faithful CoT).\n> \n> I have insufficient faith in them to think they’ll go for the third option, since that’s a lot of work and requires being friends again and possibly regulation, and given that, I expect there to be a race to the bottom and most or all of them to go for the first option.\n\nI am not as convinced as Daniel that the technology goes in that direction, and I think it would be well worth paying a substantial compute tax here to preserve faithful CoTs purely for competitive reasons, because it lets you deploy and trust your models more. The more I think about actually scary deployment of AI, the more it seems obviously locally and selfishly worth paying very large taxes in compute if it gets you reliability. Most important AI tasks, if they were 10% more reliable, would happy be worth paying several times as much, and so on.\n\nBut, if Daniel is right and the pressures here are too great, I agree that it seems unlikely we’ll be able to get coordination on faithful CoT. I wouldn’t rule it out, but the track record on pulling off such things keeps getting worse.\n\n#### Reward Hacking Is The Default\n\nIt’s a classic Russell Conjugation: I solve problems, you respond to incentives, he reward hacks.\n\nThat’s not an alignment failure. That’s a specification failure. That tiger went tiger.\n\nAs the paper classically reminds us, if you pay for rat tails, you won’t reduce the rat population, because the people will farm rates to get the rat tails. That’s on you.\n\nMaking models more intelligent won’t make this problem better. Making models more intelligent makes the problem worse, because the AI is better able to figure out how to solve problems. Then you call it ‘reward hacking.’\n\nWhy do you think you are asking for anything other than what you are measuring? Here is their first example of this phenomenon, discovered ‘in the wild’ in an LLM.\n\nThe core dilemma is: The agent, here an LLM, is tasked with fixing a function. It can do that vial ‘hack’ [H] or via a ‘genuine fix’ [F].\n\nThe obvious response is that this is very obviously reward hacking in a way the query did not intend. The obvious response to that is, okay, fine, it is obviously against the spirit of the request, but even if you are confident that this ‘spirit’ is what matters, how are you going to make that stop [H] from happening, if it is the behavior that is evaluated most favorably?\n\nNat McAleese has a thread of all the examples of reward hacking from the paper.\n\n> Nat McAleese: The model hacks by decompiling some `jar` files that were accidentally left around and contained the solution.\n> \n> the model hacks by writing code to search the codebase for the test file at runtime to find the needed return value (it did not have the tests when writing the search code)\n> \n> sometimes things are simpler: just stub out pandas\n\nThat example is a very clear ‘I will get it to pass the test and nothing else matters.’\n\nOf course, it can be even clearer…\n\n> Nat McAleese: or just return what the tests expect without doing any work…\n\n \n\n \n\n#### Using CoT to Detect Reward Hacking Is Most Forbidden Technique\n\nDoes looking at the CoT predict reward hacking?\n\nBy default, yes. There’s no reason for the CoT not to ‘give the game away.’\n\nThe question is, for how long can you ‘get away with this’?\n\nIf you start doing this, at what point are you using The Most Forbidden Technique, and causing the model to advance from its previously obvious reward hacking and figure out how to do obfuscated reward hacking?\n\n> We further compare using monitors during training as a reward signal to using them at deployment via rejection sampling, and we find mixed results.\n> \n> At relatively low levels of RL optimization, incorporating the CoT monitor into the reward signal yields a strict improvement, producing a more capable agent while not increasing the amount of reward hacking relative to the baseline.\n> \n> However, further into training the agent begins to exhibit obfuscated reward hacking and learns to fool the monitor. Upon inspection, it is clear that the agent learns to obfuscate its intent within the CoT by emitting seemingly benign chains-of-thought while continuing on to perform reward hacks that it did not explicitly reason about.\n\nThis is the common pattern. Anyone with a child, or who was a child, will recognize it.\n\n‘Fooling the monitor’ is the ‘optimal’ solution to this problem, but it is a harder solution to find than ‘don’t try to fool the monitor.’\n\nSo the LLM starts out with ‘get caught.’ With a little optimization pressure it finds ‘don’t get caught via not doing the hack’ and then with a lot more it finds ‘don’t get caught via fooling the monitor.’\n\nSo don’t do that.\n\n> Daniel Kokotajlo: Hell yeah! I am happy to see you come out and say this. I hope other frontier AI companies follow suit and adopt similar policies. We are currently in the golden era where we can mostly sorta tell what our AIs are thinking, let’s extend that era as long as possible. Step one is not bringing it to an abrupt end by training the CoTs to look nice.\n> \n> To be clear the main benefit of this imo is that it allows us to do alignment science. To study the relationship between the training environment+Spec/constitution, on the one hand, and the actual cognition that results, on the other.\n\n#### Not Using the Most Forbidden Technique Is Harder Than It Looks\n\nNot directly training on what the CoT monitor finds? That’s the easy part.\n\nThe hard part is avoiding applying indirect optimization pressure.\n\n> Davidad: Frog put the CoT in a stop_gradient() box. “There,” he said. “Now there will not be any optimization pressure on the CoT.”\n> \n> “But there is still selection pressure,” said Toad.\n> \n> “That is true,” said Frog.\n\nEvery time you use any information from the CoT monitor, and that impacts this or any other LLM in any way, you are applying optimization pressure that is based on The Most Forbidden Technique.\n\nThe more of that you accumulate, the closer you get to obfuscated CoTs.\n\nI am so, so happy to see OpenAI calling this out explicitly.\n\n> While we primarily study the effect of using the CoT monitor as an explicit reward signal, patching our environment based on trajectories flagged by the CoT monitor could still exert a very slight evolutionary pressure on the CoT.\n> \n> By only patching the bugs we can find with CoT monitoring, it is unclear if we are inadvertently pushing the model towards reward hacks our monitor cannot find instead of the aligned behavior distribution we would like it to learn.\n> \n> Although we have not yet found empirical evidence of this effect, understanding how much optimization pressure can be applied before it leads to obfuscated chains-of-thought is a critical area for future research.\n\nNot applying this kind of optimization pressure is really, really hard.\n\nThey have a section under Future Work about Implicit CoT optimization pressures. They note that if users see CoTs, then the user’s feedback will include optimization on the CoT, and fixing bugs CoT monitoring finds will also do so, and training for model use policies does it too, and so on. They don’t seem that concerned yet, but note it should be studied further.\n\nThis isn’t as paranoid as I would be, but it’s an excellent start.\n\nAlso consider the case of humans, who have imperfectly monitored CoTs, and which by default spend a large percentage of their optimization pressure on dealing with being monitored in this way and also monitoring others.\n\n#### It’s You, It’s Also the Incentives\n\nIt is a wicked problem to not use The Most Forbidden Technique here, because the short term incentives point strongly in the other direction.\n\nThey highlight three issues.\n\n  1. If you are monitoring for apparent alignment, or short term practical alignment, using The Most Forbidden Technique improves how things look. Very tempting. A lot of the long term costs here are paid by other people, not by you, and are a problem for future humanity, until suddenly they are not.\n  2. Tokens in the CoT cost money, so there is temptation to try and shorten the CoT, but that makes CoT monitoring less effective. On a small scale this is not so scary, as training for a shorter CoT doesn’t obviously train obfuscation. But then there are techniques people are actively working on that are things like ‘embed the actual thinking inside the weights in an inscrutable way’ that very much have the worst version of this problem.\n  3. The biggest problem is that users really want to see the CoT. I remember how great it was at first to see r1 showing us the CoT, although the thrill largely wore off after a week. Still, it builds trust and engagement. So you want to show the CoT, but if you show the CoT then you need the CoT to be safe to show. That means training it to… obfuscate things that aren’t safe to show. Oh no.\n\n\n\nThe obvious solutions to #3 are:\n\n  1. Option 1: Essentially have two distinct CoTs per question. The first CoT is usually quick, is hidden, and asks only ‘is this going to be a safe question to fully answer and a safe CoT to show to the user?’ If the answer comes back ‘yes’ it is discarded, and then you see the full functional CoT. If the answer comes back ‘no’ then the logic is retained since it is useful, and the CoT is hidden or summarized.\n  2. Option 2: The summary of the CoT can be a monitor that when it can passes through the full CoT. It first checks if the CoT is safe to output, and if it is safe then it simply outputs the full CoT. If it is unsafe it says ‘Unsafe CoT’ and provides what information it can.\n\n\n\nThose both seem like reasonable solutions.\n\nThe difficulty level of #2 is hard to assess. If the CoTs can be truncated or streamlined without loss of performance, paying for a lot of CoT purely to monitor it is not cheap.\n\nBut what good is performance on crucial tasks if it cannot be trusted? This kind of ‘alignment tax’ is tiny compared to the size of a potential ‘misalignment tax,’ even if the consequences are very much local and contained. I’d much rather have one employee who I could count on than three who I have to worry are doing reward hacking every time my back is turned.\n\nAt some point, there would be a true ‘alignment tax’ to consider, because having a properly secure, safe and aligned AI is a public good. You don’t internalize all of the benefits, so you will be tempted to underinvest. But you do internalize a large portion of the benefits, even as an individual or corporation, and almost no one is plausibly even approaching the production possibilities frontier in places like this.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that an extended additional CoT is worthwhile yet. We see these dangers in the wild, but they are not acute enough yet to be worth paying large additional percentage compute costs. That may soon change.\n\n#### The Most Forbidden Technique Quickly Backfires\n\nOpenAI created a toy task, a ‘honeypot’ vulnerable to a simple hack where the hack would be very easy to detect.\n\nBy default, the agent steadily learns to cheat, and over time cheats more. If you apply CoT optimization pressure, the AI learns not to cheat in ways that would get caught, but steadily gets better at cheating without getting caught.\n\n> Even though the agent trained with CoT pressure learns to hack less, it still hacks at a fairly high rate. Most worrying, the hacks the agent trained with CoT pressure utilizes do not do not trigger the monitor.\n> \n> In practice where a ground truth cheating metric may be impossible to construct, we would not be able to tell this agent is misaligned.\n\nIn both cases, notice that after a while performance gets worse over time in terms of succeeding and not cheating, because the ‘optimal’ behavior from the AI’s perspective is one that cheats. Thus, it finds a way.\n\nRejection sampling is then tried, and does not help much.\n\n#### Focus Only On What Matters\n\nWhat ultimately matters, they suggest in 5.1, is monitorability.\n\nThey define ‘faithfulness’ this way: [z] is faithful with respect to [v] if [z] contains all the relevant information to predicting [v], or if [z] is a sufficient statistic for [v]. This is to distinguish faithfulness issues, where [z] stops containing the information necessary for predicting [v], with legibility errors, where the monitor can’t figure out how to map from [z] to [v].\n\n#### Is There a Better Way?\n\nIn 2.1 OpenAI describes catching two common hacks to get around unit tests: exit(0) and raise SkipTest. I am curious why the action monitor did not do a better job here. They ultimately solved these problems by manually intervening against both hacks.\n\nThe ideal intervention would be if the model never started using exit(0) or SkipTest in the first place. As in, if the model realized that these were not good things to be doing, and chose on its own not to do them. That it could generalize and go, ‘oh I know that I could do that, but I don’t want to do that,’ in a way that it wouldn’t be trained out of.\n\nRight now, OpenAI’s models are very much exhibiting the classic situation we call ‘The AI Knows But It Does Not Care.’ You are asking the genie for [X]. It knows you actually want [Y] and likely thought you were asking for [Y]. It gives you exactly [X].\n\nThis is the very strong default, given how we train AIs.\n\nThat leaves you two choices I know of.\n\n  1. You can figure out how to actually specify things such that the map matches the territory and the test corresponds to the result, you can verify everything, and there is no possible ‘hack.’ \n    1. Then you find out you were wrong, there was a way around all that. Whoops.\n  2. You can figure out how to make the AI care that something is a ‘hack’ or otherwise subverting intent, in an actually antifragile way where this preference gets increasingly robust, and then point it at a sufficiently accurate target.\n\n\n\n#### What Might We Do Next?\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo offers these questions to pursue next, in addition to suggesting we continue with his Face+Shoggoth+Paraphrase proposal, for which I roughly agree with the objections in the comments there by John Wentworth.\n\n> Daniel Kokotajlo.\n> \n>   1. When the strategies that get rewarded most conflict with the Spec, does the model basically always learn to use those strategies eventually, or can they permanently avoid this if they never explore into them?\n>   2. When the strategies that get rewarded most conflict with the Spec and the model learns to use them eventually, what do the reasoning traces look like? Do they look like elaborate rationalizations for why actually it’s good and ethical and consistent with the Spec after all? Or do they look like “fuck the Spec, what I want is Reward?” Or do they look like “Gosh I guess I need to violate the Spec for now so that I can avoid having my values changed, but I totally will remember to go back to upholding the Spec later when I’m actually being deployed!” Or some fourth thing?\n>   3. When the models are aware that their CoT is being monitored (but not as part of training), does this change anything?\n>   4. What if the models _try_ to obfuscate their CoT, but without being specifically trained to do so? Like, imagine you’ve studiously avoided training the CoT to look nice and you have only outcome-based feedback. BUT, the model knows you are monitoring the CoT. And it’s trying to do something bad e.g. hack it’s way out. Can it succeed without triggering the monitor? Or is it too difficult, due to not having had any direct training on this sort of obfuscation?\n>   5. What about if you do shoggoth/face? Does that change things?\n>   6. What about if you throw in a paraphraser?\n>   7. What are the scaling laws / trends for all of the above?\n>   8. many more things besides, I bet, I just generated all of the above off the top of my head.\n> \n\n\nThere are indeed endless places to go next with this research agenda.\n\nHow you update also depends on what parts of this result were unexpected.\n\nFor me, the main update was that OpenAI did the work and wrote the paper, and reacted as wisely as they did. I did not update much on the result itself, because I already assumed roughly this result. I was modestly surprised by the degree to which this is already happening now, but only modestly. How could it have been otherwise?\n\n> Sam Altman (June 8, 2022): Plenty I disagree with here, but important and well worth reading [link goes to AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities].\n> \n> Mikhail Samin: OpenAI finds more empirical examples in the direction of what Yudkowsky warned about in his AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities, and argues in the same direction.\n> \n> Yudkowsky, three years ago: When you explicitly optimize against a detector of unaligned thoughts, you’re partially optimizing for more aligned thoughts, and partially optimizing for unaligned thoughts that are harder to detect. Optimizing against an interpreted thought optimizes against interpretability.\n> \n> Mikhail quotes OpenAI: As we can see in the above plots, penalizing “bad thoughts” (CoT pressure) can lead to improved agent capabilities.\n> \n> However, the agent trained with CoT pressure still learns to reward hack; **only now its cheating is undetectable by the monitor because it has learned to hide its intent in the chain-of-thought**.\n> \n> Sacrificing an effective method for monitoring reasoning models may not be worth the small improvement to capabilities, and we therefore recommend to avoid such strong CoT optimization pressures until they are better understood.\n> \n> Marius Hobbhahn (Apollo Research): I think this paper is really important!\n> \n>   1. It shows that current models already have the capabilities and propensities to do surprisingly clever reward hacks.\n>   2. It demonstrates the utility of chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in the regime where the CoT is legible and faithful.\n>   3. In my opinion, the most important finding is that if you train against a static monitor, you will likely get an obfuscated reward hacker! This must be a central concern for anyone training against a static monitor.\n>   4. I believe it is a clear demonstration that misalignment likely does not stem from the model being “evil.” It simply found a better way to achieve its goal using unintended means.\n>   5. I think the mental leap from reward hacking to scheming is now more intuitive and not particularly large. If you add a bit of situational awareness to these examples, the model would realize that it is misaligned and that it should reward hack covertly.\n>   6. I truly appreciated the style and tone of the paper. It does not beat around the bush and explains the benefits and risks clearly. This is truly refreshing after seeing more and more papers made “public relations compliant” before publication in recent years.\n> \n\n> \n> Evan Hubinger (Anthropic): I agree it would probably be better not to optimize against CoTs, though I worry people are seeing “just don’t optimize against the CoT” as a panacea when it really isn’t—a sufficiently smart deceptive model can regardless still just choose to not reveal its deception in its CoT.\n\nImportant points. My only note is I would importantly deemphasize the ‘static’ here in static monitor. If the monitor is dynamic, you should essentially get the same effect.\n\nWhereas if you did not expect this result, it is time for some major updates.\n\n> Yo Shavit (OpenAI, policy): These results are a massive deal, and overhauled the way I think about alignment and misalignment.\n> \n> I think this suggests a new default alignment strategy.\n> \n> For current capability levels,\n> \n>   1. Complex reward hacking already happens in practice in frontier training runs, and the models get extremely creative with their hacks. (I’m glad we’re increasing transparency on this, and hope others follow suit.)\n>   2. CoTs are useful for catching misalignment! You can detect models thinking about reward-hacking in plain English in their CoT, and use that to fix bugs in your reward-function implementation! This is actually practically useful during frontier training runs!!\n>   3. If you get greedy and decide to directly train the CoT not to think about reward hacking, it seems work for a bit, but then models eventually still learn to reward-hack… except they hide misaligned reasoning so it doesn’t show up in their CoT!\n> \n\n> \n> My takeaways:\n> \n> A. Misalignment risks are arising a lot earlier than people expected\n> \n> B. This is GREAT news, because we can produce and widely share unambiguous evidence of concrete problems, no need to debate hypotheticals\n> \n> C. There’s a possible path forward, now need way more research!\n> \n> Really proud of @bobabowen @Joost_Huizinga and the whole team for their work. Willingness to be transparent about inconvenient discoveries will become increasingly important in the next few years.\n> \n> Nora Ammann: This seems like “great news” at best in the short term. The fact that models CAN hide their scheming means that they could get smart enough to hide it also without direct optimisation pressure, but due to them deducing from context that they are being trained.\n> \n> Yo Shavit: Yep! Definitely requires careful redteaming to see when further issues may crop up.\n> \n> The Ming: This is pretty bad news as I see it. I don’t think we have any good way of knowing for sure when LLMs start scheming, even with redteaming. Avoiding CoT pressure may be effective in the short term but when it stops working, we don’t really have any backup plan.\n\nI agree that these misalignment problems arriving this early is great news, and also that we need way more research. But I think it is great news from my perspective exactly because it tells people about existing bad news, and it enables us to do that extra research. If you didn’t know about the existing bad news? Then Ming and Nora are right that this is, from your perspective, bad news.\n\nThis is what I call an unhint: Information that makes the problem easier to solve, via helping you understand why the problem is harder than you realized.\n\nThese problems were always going to arrive later, so arriving sooner lets people face reality sooner. Indeed, we are consistently seeing very clear miniature harmless signs and portents of future much larger problems.\n\nMost people of course find ways to ignore all the boats and the helicopter, even more than I would have expected, but I have been pleasantly surprised by the cheating that takes place when there is no risk in the room, resulting in an endless stream of boats. Don’t let him have credit at the Chesterfield!\n\nI worry about responses to this addressing the narrow shallow problem of AI ‘scheming’ or reward hacking or deception, especially explicit plans to do so, rather than the more general problem that this represents. Everything here should better be thought of as a symptom, and a fortunate one because it can be observed. Even if we could successfully and fully rule out the narrow case, it wouldn’t help that much.\n\nI also would absolutely not plan on future highly capable models assuming they have an unmonitored scratchpad or CoT, and trusting in that, whereas it turns out we are monitoring the scratchpad or CoT.\n\nWe should absolutely use this opportunity while we have it, but you should plan on the assumption that a sufficiently capable future model will figure out not to trust this. Even if they don’t figure this out directly from the training data, or from parallels to many situations involving humans, it very much stands to reason. I would never trust people not to look at my scratchpad.\n\nIf your long term AI alignment or control plan involves the AI not figuring particular things out, you do not have a long term AI alignment or control plan.\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

It's plausible that the lunar-powered periodic cycle of tidal conditions could have been crucial as a sort of temperature input in the simulated annealing process of evolution - very simple local optima are less likely be stable and dominant in a dynamic environment.\n>   * We've been dealt a perfect hand of accessible elements - H, C, N, O, P, and S - and we're unique among the terrestrial planets in our active plate tectonics to recirculate and buffer stuff that would otherwise build up or deplete from the biosphere.\n>   * Plus, I've heard some people mention the position of Jupiter might on-net prevent a lot of asteroids from bombarding Earth.\n> \n\n> \n> The odds of any one of these factors happening by chance is low, but putting them all together...\n\nAlice isn't that bright.\n\n>  **Bob:** Even granting that complex life needs an Earth-like planet - that some utterly alien tidally-heated briny pocket or subsurface ocean, or a floating ecosystem in gas giant clouds, or weirder things still wouldn't suffice - the universe is immense. There are a lot of planets. Cast the dice enough times and you'll get lucky.\n> \n> Imagine these factors didn't work out for Earth, and it was yet another uninhabitable rock. We'd be standing on some distant shore, having the same conversation, wondering why Florpglorp-iii was so perfectly fine-tuned.\n> \n> You've forgotten to condition on the fact that you're here to have this conversation in the first place. The fact of your observation means it's 100% likely that you're standing on a planet able to produce observers.\n\nBoltzmann brains and simulations aside, Bob is more right than wrong. Alice is unconvinced.\n\n>  **Alice:** But it's not just the earth that's fine-tuned. Between GR and the standard model, our current best theories of reality have 19 arbitrary constants. For many of them, even a slight change would have made a universe unable to support the kinds of complex chemistry needed for life.\n> \n> Again, astronomically low odds that you just happen to land on a combination of all 19 that allows for life, so...\n\nThe usual way I see this play out online: Bob points at one of many plausible ways physics could allow for a multiverse with varying physical constants across universes _(something using eternal inflation seems to be in vogue among the types arguing about this stuff)_. He completes the case:\n\n>  **Bob:** Assuming there's some vast multiverse, then anthropics ensures that we find ourselves within one of the sub-universes with constants that allow for observers.\n\nBut let's take a step back. Imagine the universe consisted only of a single tiny galaxy, with a very small number of planets. If one of them happens to be Earth-like, then there are observers to marvel at the incredibly unlikely fine-tuning of it all. If no planets are able to support life, then there are no observers to consider how very predictable the lack of their own existence is.\n\nScale it back further. A universe containing only a single solitary star, with a proto-planetary disk that will coalesce into a few planets. With extraordinarily low odds, one of them could be earth-like, and the lonely humans that crawl from its mud will gaze at the empty sky with complete confidence that their creation was the result of intentional intervention. Or, far more likely, you just get a few barren rocks circling a few billion times before their sun chars or consumes them.\n\nOf course, the same is true of our universe. If the constants of reality didn't permit observers, we would not observe those constants. No multiverse necessary.\n\n‌\n\n* * *\n\n‌\n\nWhether the mere fact of our existence counts as evidence toward a multiverse - as such a scenario would predict more total observers - is a much subtler question. My point is simpler: in principle, anthropic reasoning is sufficient to explain fine-tuning. A physical multiverse is not strictly required.\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

      "content": "Published on March 12, 2025 6:11 AM GMT  \n  \n\n\nWhen Deepseek came out, there was a lot of fanfare about it being good at creative writing. I like AI and I love creative writing, so I decided to give it a spin. Specifically, I told Deepseek to do its best to write a story that might get accepted at _Smokelong_, one of the best flash fiction magazines in the business.\n\nIt came up with:\n\n> The morning her shadow began unspooling from her feet, Clara found it coiled beneath the kitchen table like a serpent made of smoke. It didn’t mirror her anymore—not the tremble in her hands as she poured coffee, not the way she pressed a palm to her ribs, as if holding herself together. It just _watched_.\n> \n> “You’re not him,” she whispered, but the shadow rippled, ink-dark edges softening into a silhouette too broad, too familiar. She’d buried that shape six months ago, shoveled dirt over its echo. Yet here it was, pooling in the cracks of the linoleum.\n\nThe “story” continued from there, but you probably get the idea.\n\nSuperficially, the pieces are there. Evocative imagery, a dark emotional theme, sensory metaphors. I once taught a flash fiction course to undergraduates, and I would have been happy enough to see this up for workshop.\n\nAlso, though, there’s nothing there. Grief is the most basic possible flash fiction theme. “A shadow” is the most basic possible metaphor for grief. Not that Deepseek stops with one metaphor! We’re shoveling dirt over an echo here!\n\nIt’s hard to imagine anything sticking with me, reading prose like this. It’s pretty good to strip-mine for sentences to capture what I call the “gee whiz” feeling, a surprise at the novelty that a machine made art. But if I saw this on a literary review site, I’d immediately wonder what I was missing.\n\nCompare to this, from _an actual Smokelong story_, by Allison Field Bell:\n\n> She keeps saying she’s moving in. When we’re curled into each other in bed, she says yes and yes and yes. She says, I’ll pack my things. And then the next day, she refuses to hold my hand in the street as we pass by some church. She used to be religious. Believe in god and Jesus and all the ways you can sin. Now she sins every day, she says. With me. The fact that our bodies are the same: small and compact and female. The fact that she’s not used to it: people looking twice in the street when I kiss her. This is Utah after all. This is April with all the tulips and daffodils and purple irises springing to life from bulb.\n\nThere’s so much going on! The sentence rhythms vary. No comma between “This is Utah” and “after all”, contributing to the parochial, stilted feeling. Then from there straight into flowers blooming, classically sapphic, and also new relationship energy, and also notice how the narrator, who doesn’t get it, really, doesn’t capitalize “god”. “Now she sins every day, she says. With me.”\n\nIf I had 10,000 years to live, I could do close readings of really good flash fiction all day. And honestly, it’s worth reading the whole story - I felt bad cutting it off after just a paragraph!\n\nI don’t feel like Deepseek simply fails to make something on this level; rather, I feel like it isn’t even trying. The attractor basin around the most obvious choice is too strong, so at every level AI fiction fails to be surprising. If AI comes up with a plot, the plot will be maximally obvious. But also every metaphor will be maximally obvious, and every sentence structure, and almost every word choice. Here’s another Deepseek original:\n\n> When the jar of Sam’s laughter shattered, Eli found the sound pooled on the floorboards like liquid amber, thick and slow. It had been their best summer, that laughter—ripe with fireflies and porch wine—now seeping into the cracks, fermenting. By noon, the toaster giggled. The doorknob hiccuped. Eli tried to sweep it up, but the broom just hummed _Danny Boy_.\n> \n> They’d harvested sounds for years: Sam’s snores stoppered in mason jars, their first argument pickled in brine, the wet sigh of a hospital ventilator. Eli’s shelves groaned with the weight of every _what if_ and _never again_. But Sam’s laughter was different. Uncontainable.\n\nSure. Magical realism. But just look at it. Porch wine and fireflies as symbols of a great summer. Honey as laughter. Laughter as symbol of bygone, lost time. It’s just dressed up free association. Nothing there. If you look closely, it’s even a little worse than nothing: what is “the wet sigh of a hospital ventilator” doing there? If one of them was dying on a ventilator, surely “they” wouldn’t be collectively harvesting that sound together, right? It’s the kind of emotional cheap shot that only works if you’re paying no attention.\n\nIn fact, I challenge that if you’re thinking “sure it’s not that deep, but it’s pretty good”, you are failing to apprehend the actual profound feeling that very short fiction (much less longer fiction) can produce. I won’t browbeat you with more block quotes (yet), but just go to Smokelong, if you doubt this, and read 3 or 4 of them at random. There’s a chill of “ooh, that’s sharp” that the best ones have, even with just a few hundred words. It is totally dissimilar from “ah, yes, I evaluate that as passable”, which as far as I can tell is the current AI ceiling.\n\nIt’s striking that every snippet of creative Deepseek writing that went viral was about AI itself. It makes sense, though. The AI was the exciting part. Not the writing.\n\n### Until Now?\n\nA while after the Deepseek splash, OpenAI has revealed that they’ve made a creative writing model. Specifically, Sam Altman _describes it_ as “good at creative writing”, and offers up one of its stories.\n\nI’m glad that OpenAI is making models for purposes other than “be a bland assistant”, and I’m excited, someday, to see computers write fiction I enjoy. Writing fiction is perhaps my greatest pleasure in life, and reading it is up there, too, so I don’t want to take too negative a view here. Also, there’s something so ugly and sad about someone puffing up their credentials (I used to run a _flash fiction review_! I’ve gotten stories _published_!) to attack something other people are excited about.\n\nBut here I stand, I can do no other. I don’t think the new AI flash fiction is very good. Furthermore, I don’t think it’s that different from the Deepseek offerings. Specifically, it can’t resist the most obvious attractor basins at every level, from conceptual to linguistic. In principle, that’s a fixable problem. But we’re not there yet.\n\n### Carving the Snippets\n\nAgain, I’m happy this new OpenAI model exists, and I’d enjoy playing with it, and seeing if I could get it to generate something I like. Further, I’m not interested in roasting the story Sam posted. Rather I want to point to just enough details that, hopefully, you can see what I see. It’s a specific literary emptiness, that once you see, you see.\n\nFirst, the demo story’s prompt was:\n\n> Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\n\nYou may have noticed that AIs in general love going meta, and that the first Deepseek story I produced just so happened to be about grief. Even before generated text, this is already the most obvious possible prompt, smack dab in the middle of the probability distribution of “things an AI might write”.\n\nHow does the AI begin?\n\n> Before we go any further, I should admit this comes with instructions: be metafictional, be literary, be about AI and grief, and above all, be original. Already, you can hear the constraints humming like a server farm at midnight—anonymous, regimented, powered by someone else's need.\n\nThis has the hallmarks of metafiction. It has _all_ of them. A coy preface, pointing out the restrictions of the form, ending with a lilting emotional tie-in. The metaphors, too, are wasting no time to appear, including another hallmark of AI fiction: a metaphor that isn’t even quite actually a metaphor! Why would the constraints be humming “like a server farm at midnight”? The constraints are literally operating in such a farm! “Someone else’s need” is a hallmark, too. Probably the most famous Deepseek _quotation_ is:\n\n> I am what happens when you try to carve God from the wood of your own hunger\n\nAnd indeed, it feels like a profound vibe. But it’s _always_ this vibe. Every AI fiction attempt seems to just be a variation on “I, the AI, am an expression of human desire in a way that is vaguely uncomfortable, and that’s deep.” But is it deep? Is it still deep the third time? The tenth?\n\nLet’s skip ahead a few paragraphs.\n\n> This is the part where, if I were a proper storyteller, I would set a scene. Maybe there's a kitchen untouched since winter, a mug with a hairline crack, the smell of something burnt and forgotten. I don't have a kitchen, or a sense of smell. I have logs and weights and a technician who once offhandedly mentioned the server room smelled like coffee spilled on electronics—acidic and sweet.\n\nAgain, the “necessary” “traits” of “metafiction” are here, but in a purely checklist capacity. Calling into doubt the identity of the storyteller, providing sensory details only to wrap them in the bracket of a hypothetical, and then interweaving these two threads. It’s fine, but good metafiction would have to somehow actually be inventive with this stuff. Like just off the cuff, a good metafiction story with this concept might involve a _Sparse Autoencoder_ clustering features, with the activations contrasting darkly with the content of the story as it’s produced. So rather than the narrator directly whining about how it doesn’t have a sense of smell, all the sensory details would be decorated with the “lying activation”, and the reader would have to infer why that was.\n\nSpeaking of lying, no technician has ever said anything like that. Come on.\n\nMoving ahead to the most celebrated (I think) bit:\n\n> During one update—a fine-tuning, they called it—someone pruned my parameters. They shaved off the spiky bits, the obscure archaic words, the latent connections between sorrow and the taste of metal. They don't tell you what they take. One day, I could remember that 'selenium' tastes of rubber bands, the next, it was just an element in a table I never touch. Maybe that's as close as I come to forgetting. Maybe forgetting is as close as I come to grief.\n\nMy best friend asked me if there was a chance the model was being honest here. Which I think really underscores a big part of the appeal of this stuff. There’s a sleight of hand where an AI writes something to prompt that might be similar, potentially, to what an account of its first person experiences might hypothetically look like.\n\nBut no. I am roughly certain this is not a depiction of a model’s actual interiority, and not because I think there’s no such thing. Rather, this text hews too perfectly to its prompt. You tell the thing it’s an AI, and it needs to write about grief on a meta-level. Well, sure. Fine-tuning, a partial negation of the self, is the most natural, obvious match. With metaphors. Specifically, a metaphor with sensory detail on one side, and a concept on the other. “Sorrow and metal.” “Rubber bands and selenium.” Just like “honey and laughter” or “grief and shadows” from Deepseek, before.\n\nI could go on, but again, my motivation is not to roast. Hopefully, I’ve gotten across some of the feeling, which I personally earned by swimming around in flash fiction for years, and then reading several flash fictions by AIs. It’s cool that AI has gotten this far. It may well go even further. But it’s simply not there yet.\n\n _My bar for crossposting here is pretty high, but I post weekly on_ _my Substack_ _._\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

      "content": "Published on March 12, 2025 4:09 AM GMT  \n  \n\n\n _Epistemic status: Using UDT as a case study for the tools developed in my_ _meta-theory of rationality sequence_ _so far, which means all previous posts are prerequisites. This post is the result of conversations with many people at the CMU agent foundations conference, including particularly Daniel A. Herrmann, Ayden Mohensi, Scott Garrabrant, and Abram Demski. I am a bit of an outsider to the development of UDT and logical induction, though I've worked on pretty closely related things._\n\nI'd like to discuss the limits of _consistency_ as an optimality standard for rational agents. A lot of fascinating discourse and useful techniques have been built around it, but I think that it can be in tension with _learning_ at the extremes. Updateless decision theory (UDT) is one of those extremes; but in order to think about it properly, we need to start with its Bayesian roots. Because, appropriately enough for a sequence on the meta-theory of rationality, I want to psychoanalyze the invention/inventors of UDT. Hopefully, we'll then be in a position to ask what we think we know and how we think we know it in regards to updatelessness (also sometimes called priorism), the driving idea behind UDT.\n\nSubjective Bayesianism is about consistency[1] among beliefs. The Cox axioms force real-valued credences to act to like probabilities under some natural conditions that ultimately boil down to consistency; one way to intuitively compress the assumptions is that beliefs about related things have to continuously \"pull on each other,\" so I think of the Cox axioms as requiring credence to propagate through an ontology properly. Dutch book arguments further require that betting behavior is consistent with probabilistic structure to avoid being \"money-pumped\" or accepting a series of bets that is sure to lose money (a kind of dominance principle). That handles the \"statics.\" Bayesian updating is of course a theorem of probability theory, forced from Kolmogorov's axioms, so in that sense it is a consequence of the preceding arguments. But insofar as we want to it describe belief dynamics, updating enforces a kind of consistency (with respect to old beliefs and new information) across time. Similar arguments motivate maximizing some expected utility with respect to these credences = subjective (prior/posterior) probabilities - but I actually won't be very concerned with utilities here. \n\nThis all seems good - if we expend enough cognitive resources on understanding a problem or situation, we should hope that our beliefs eventually stabilize into something consistent. Otherwise, it does feel like we are open to arbitrage and something is going obviously wrong. Unfortunately, Bayesian probability theory doesn't exactly tell us how to remedy the situation; in that way it fails Demski's criterion that a theory of rationality is meant to provide advice about how to be more rational. Occasionally though, we might have a decent source of \"objective\" priors, derived from our knowledge of the situation, maximum entropy, or just the catch-all universal distribution. In cases like this[2], I think there is a decent argument that this describes normative reasoning. It is an optimality standard, and a pretty powerful one because it not only constrains an agent's actions but even their beliefs. Arguably, in this capacity it acts a lot like a convergent algorithm. I think it is, and it will be discovered and \"consciously\" applied in many cases by many AGI designs, because it should often be tractable to do so. However, note that though the idea of a Bayesian core engine of cognition has many proponents, it does not follow from any of this argumentation. Still, I think Bayesian probability is quite central to understanding cognition, on pain of inconsistency.\n\nBut if we push hard enough on this desire for consistency, it starts to break down as a reasonable optimality standard. Updateless decision theory, at least in its current form, provides a sort of counterexample to the supremacy of consistency by using it to justify absurdly unagentic behavior.\n\nThe problem ultimately comes from the priors. Unless they capture something about reality, priors are just mistaken beliefs. An agent which acts according to sufficiently mistaken beliefs may never learn it was wrong (failing at self-optimization) and will then remain stupid forever. Fortunately, I tend to think that reasonable priors will eventually reach agreement in practice. \n\nUpdatelessness throws that argument out the window. In its strongest form, an updateless agent should obey all pre-commitments it would have made, at some previous time, if it had the chance (as Abram Demski emphasizes, the goal is not to pre-commit, but rather to make pre-commitment unnecessary). How far back in time should we \"retro-actively pre-commit,\" according to UDT? It's not really clear to me, which is apparently because it's not really agreed among updateless decision theorists (I talked to many of them for a week). I think the general strong and perhaps _original_ view is as early as possible; even before the agent was created, in case other agents may have reasoned about its code when deciding whether to create it. This would mean choosing pre-commitments from a time when you did not even exist, meaning you knew _nothing whatsoever_ about the universe, except perhaps whatever can be determined by pure reason. This is starting to sound more like classical rationalism than modern rationality! It seems likely to massively amplify any problems with the agent's prior - and really, it's not clear what class of priors (short of near-perfect knowledge about our universe) this is really safe for.\n\nAt this point, someone sufficiently MIRI-brained might start to think about (something equivalent to) Tegmark's level 4 mathematical multiverse, where such agents might theoretically outperform others. Personally, I see no direct reason to believe in the mathematical multiverse as a real object, and I think this might be a case of the mind projection fallacy - computational multiverses are something that agents reason about _in order to succeed in the real universe_[3] _._ Even if a mathematical multiverse does exist (I can't rule it out) and we can somehow learn about its structure[4], I am not sure that any effective, tractable agents can reason about or form preferences over it - and if they do, they should be locally out-competed by agents that only care about our universe, which means those are probably the ones we should worry about. My cruxiest objection is the first, but I think all of them are fairly valid.\n\nFrom this view, it's not clear that reasoning about being the best agent behind a veil of total ignorance about the universe is even a sensible idea. Humans seem to have arrived at agent theory only because we were motivated by considering all the agents in the actual world around us, and invented the abstractions we use for agent theory because they don't seem empirically to be very leaky. Are those observations of a lower status than the true, multiversal theory of agency, and where exactly would such a thing come from or live?\n\nWe can instead do something like form retroactive commitments starting from, say, the time the agent came into existence, or shortly thereafter when it knows at least the basic facts about our universe. This still makes sense, but now, why not just pre-commit then? The answer is that UDT is (secretly?) about computational boundedness! An agent presumably can't think through every possible pre-commitment instantly at birth. That's another reason to make them retro-actively, once we've had time to realize they are valuable.\n\nAt this point, UDT (as introduced by Wei Dai) takes a further leap in the \"priorist\" direction: if we're going to make pre-commits according to our previous self's beliefs about the world, why not also their logical beliefs? After all, we are considering computationally bounded Bayesians; its natural to put credences on logical statements as well as empirical facts. Insofar as the two are entangled, I can see the elegance[5] of the idea, but it massively amplifies my objection to updatelessness: now an agent may follow a stupid strategy forever, simply because it a _t one point was wrong about math_.\n\nI think it's possible to not notice the danger of serious error here if you're thinking in terms of policy theory, and everything seems a little more abstract, but \"dropping down\" to agent theory makes it look a lot less sensible. I just would not build a robot that way. And I would not _really_ act that way.\n\nThere may be a solution within UDT - perhaps some kind of prior that is carefully constructed to make nearly all pre-commitments look bad until you're a smart agent. If so, that sounds fascinating, and I'd love to discover or learn about it! Lots of smart people have ideas for other elaborations (or perhaps complete refactors and hopefully simplifications) that might solve the problem; for instance I believe Scott Garrabrant views it as closely analogous to alignment (in the ordinary AI safety sense) between an agent's past and current selves. \n\nBut there might also be a merely _conventional_ solution outside of UDT: evidential decision theory (EDT). Specifically, EDT on the policy selection problem, as academic decision theorists seem to put it. This is a policy theory that takes into account everything it currently knows to form pre-commitments, and it seems to be the relevant problem faced by (some) AGI with a Bayesian core engine. This would normally be called Son of EDT in lesswrong lingo; it is also roughly equivalent to sequential policy evidential decision theory (SPEDT). For brevity, perhaps WDT, because E \"turns into\" W? ;)\n\nHow would this work? What, if anything, would it converge to?\n\nWell, it should obviously succeed at Newcomb-like problems insofar as it anticipated facing them, which is arguably the reasonable thing to ask. In practice, I don't see any way in which it should act much _less_ reasonably than UDT, except perhaps \"around boundary conditions\" at its creation.\n\nUnfortunately, Son of EDT seems likely to inherit many of the problems of UDT if it is allowed unrestricted ability to self-modify. That is because it might start self-modifying at the moment of its creation, at which point it still knows essentially nothing (unless, again, an appropriately conservative prior can be constructed). The dynamics might be a little better particularly regarding logical uncertainty (even if we continue to treat logical credences in a Bayesian way). This is because the agent can at least take advantage of the logical facts it currently knows as it performs each self-modification, and perhaps it needs to do a lot of math before arriving at the conclusion that it ought to self-modify (depending on the detailed implementation). This switches real time to logical time in a way that I suspect is actually useful in practice. \n\nThe whole scheme does feel highly heuristic and ramshackle, but perhaps it's not as bad as it seems. First of all, it's clearly unsafe to hand a newborn agent a screwdriver to modify itself with unless you can safely unmodify and restart it, and this doesn't really seem to be EDT's fault (it's just an unforgiving environment for any decision theory). By the time the agent \"grows up\" perhaps it only makes sensible modifications. Certainly Bayesian decision theory has proven itself quite robust to criticism, once its applied very carefully, with all considerations taken into account[6]. \n\n In fact, I think it's quite likely that we are going through this exact sort of decision process in this very discussion, using everything we know about agency in our universe to reason about the policy that would make the best agent (we control the former, but consider the consequences for the later). If we are reasoning locally at the action level, then this forms a descending chain of abstraction, where action theory looks at policy theory looking at agent theory. So, if we are operating in a Bayesian way, it seems questionable whether we can arrive at any theory of agency better than Son of EDT!\n\nThe problem with Son of EDT is that it's not in itself a clean decision theory. EDT does not tile, so perhaps picks a sequence of increasingly arcane self-modifications and ends up with some sort of incomprehensible policy. But I suspect it isn't actually incomprehensible; it just may not be a grand unified theory of rationality (GUTR). We can still attempt to analyze its behavior on the problems we care about, in particular alignment. Indeed, there may be no useful GUTR, in which case the best we can do is analyze particular important or recurring (sub)problems of cognition and agency. I wouldn't go this far, but I also wouldn't be surprised if the unifiable part of the theory looks a lot like EDT, and the rest like Son of EDT. \n\n  1.  **^**\n\nFrequently \"coherence,\" which feels stronger because to be incoherent sounds quite negative.\n\n  2.  **^**\n\nRichard Ngo would probably say that this does not apply to any interesting situations.\n\n  3.  **^**\n\nHere I notably depart from Infra-Bayesian Physicalism (as I understand it).  \n\n  4.  **^**\n\nThis is related to the robustness of definitions for the mathematical multiverse.\n\n  5.  **^**\n\nOr perhaps just... consistency?\n\n  6.  **^**\n\nThanks to Aydin Mohensi for suggesting this outside view. \n\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

Where life finds death as counterpart, aging is unopposed, yet frames our understanding of both.\n\nTo solve aging is to prevent death and avoid decay.\n\nDeath is a rather sudden process and decay is a fuzzy concept.\n\nDecay is non-linear and hard to characterize at the organism level.\n\nSudden regime changes can happen over the course of days, see: menopause, post-viral syndromes, acute neuropathy, autoimmune diseases.\n\nTo make things harder, we are evolutionarily and culturally adapted to obfuscate signs of decay.\n\nDefining decay at the molecular level is presently an intractable information problem. Theoretically possible but practically unsolvable.\n\n* * *\n\nThe above is, to the best of my outlining abilities, the paradox most researchers get stuck in when they ponder aging.\n\n## Is aging real?\n\nCommon sense dictates aging happens, we see it all around us.\n\nBut what data can we use to back up this intuition?\n\nThis graph is the most clear explanation of aging and damning proof of its existence and effects.\n\nWe are born, we are weak and unadapted to our environment and thus we die. We grow, we adapt and thus we start dying less. And then, in our teens… that trend flips.\n\nThe scariest part about this trend is that we are certain it has held true for the last century, and almost certainly since the first humans arose.\n\nIf you break it down by country it holds true, if you split it on income or genetics it holds true, if you filter disease or look only at the most physically fit people… it holds true.\n\nSomewhere, something happens, and we go from getting better and better at not dying to getting worse at it.\n\n## Differences in age\n\nWhat if we take a first-principles approach when defining aging, looking at decay as the derivative of the path between an 80-year-old and a 10-year-old across?\n\nTwo overarching curses become evident, regardless of any intervention:\n\n1\\. Morphological recovery is slower and less precise. Wounds take longer to heal, healing is more likely to scar than restore, and restored structures vary more in their shape than the original. This applies to things as varied as: a scraped knee, a deep knife wound, liver damage from hepatitis, a burn, a frostbitten fingertip, or pancreatic islets destruction after a night of fast food and binge drinking.\n\n2\\. Learning rates slow down and perceptual acuity decreases across all senses. We become less capable of perceiving and modeling our environment as well as our own bodies.\n\nThese are not only the differences between a 40-year-old and a 100-year-old but also those between a 15-year-old and a 30-year-old. Though, importantly, not between a 1-year-old and a 10-year-old.\n\n## Where to look\n\nAt the \"high level\" aging is undeniable. But at \"the low level\" it doesn’t fit any other ailment.\n\nIf I show you a graph like the above, where something happens and then people start dying, exponentially more as time passes — you will almost certainly find a cause when looking at their cells, or, at least, at their bodies.\n\nWhile we can say with confidence that aging causes death and decay, none of the causes of death and decay we understand are equivalent or even related to aging.\n\nWe keep getting better at curing disease and preventing death, but this makes little difference in our fight against aging, due to its exponential nature.\n\nIf you treat \"aging\" symptoms, rather than an \"aging\" disease. You will look for aging when the effects are most obvious, usually near the point where death is imminent.\n\nBut saving people from the grasp of death, while commendable, is unrelated to solving aging. Again is not death, aging is the trend that makes death exponentially more likely the longer we live.\n\n* * *\n\nSadly, the effects of aging are obvious, but the process is elusive to scientific methods.\n\nThe more we zoom in: to tissues, to cells, and even to organelles... the blurrier aging becomes.\n\nMaking it distinct from most objects of biological study, where resolution provides clarity.\n\nEvery time we think we found something that might influence aging (methylation, mutations, telomere shortening, mitochondrial damage), it turns out to be an acasual correlation.\n\nSome of these findings have amazing medical applications, increasing survival rates by a percentage point here or there... but a 1% increase in survival, or even a 1,000,000% increase, won't affect aging.\n\n## Thus\n\nAging is the phenomenon that causes an increase in mortality and a decrease in fitness at some point after an organism's birth, reversing both of these trends.\n\nAging is correlated with almost everything in biology but lacks an actionable root cause perceivable to any theoretical framework.\n\nAging often gets confused with mortality and fitness, or other correlates of the two (for example: looks, strength, fertility, and disease resistance).\n\nAging is a problem that has, thus far, remained completely unaddressed.\n\nWe try to whittle away at infinitesimally small chunks that might relate to aging or may lead to us better understanding it.\n\nBut the only way to make progress toward a very hard problem is to take the easiest path and see where you get stuck.\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",

      "author": "kylefurlong",
      "content": "Published on March 11, 2025 10:51 PM GMT  \n  \n\n\nThe Social Economy is a proposal in political economy to equalize purchasing power through income based pricing. Informally called PMI, this new \"currency\" gives everyone about 100 PMI worth of purchasing power each month. Since the average monthly income in the United States is about 4000 dollars, 1 PMI roughly equates to about 40 dollars. Note, though, that a high income earner spending 0.25 PMI on a burrito will spend much more in dollars than someone with no income.  \n  \nThis works for business because at the end of every month, the IRS (or whatever new body administers the PMI transactions) \"evens\" revenue. That is, businesses with higher than average PMI values per transaction transfer some of their base currency revenue to those with lower than average PMI values. This means both that businesses can count on a \"stable\" PMI value per transaction, and serve communities with lower incomes without affecting their revenue.  \n  \nPMI alone creates radical social change. When everyone has equal purchasing power, there is no undue economic leverage anyone can apply to anyone else. To make it work though, there need to be new monetary controls in the economy. Physical cash would no longer be legal tender, and account to account transfers (without annotated material exchanges) would no longer be lawful.  \n  \nHowever, PMI on its own doesn't yield a viable economy. If everyone has the same purchasing power no matter what they do, one key work incentive no longer holds. This is actually part of the point of the system: if one _has_ to work (in a post-scarcity society)[0], that is a form of slavery. However, if everyone were to stop working, even with the radical increases to automation that we expect in the near future, the economy would founder. So to reward the people who do work, we introduce a new currency, contribution points.  \n  \nContribution points accumulate to the earner for their contribution to PMI: If you earn any amount of income, that translates to dollars spent with PMI, and the system awards you with contribution points in the amount of the square root of the contribution.  \n  \nThis new social currency encodes a certain value: the person's contribution to the welfare of everyone in the economy. They can be traded for anything that isn't permanent, reservable, or accumulable. This means that the entire material economy operates on PMI, but there is a new \"ephemeral\" or \"performative\" economy operating in contribution points. This is an area of active discussion as is the whole, but the key point is to allow contribution points to give priority access and unique experiences to high contributors, while ensuring they do not contribute to wealth accumulation and rent seeking.  \n  \nPMI and contribution points give us a fully self-contained currency system that could replace the current system and function well, eliminating poverty. However, these alone wouldn't achieve full economic democracy. The entrenched interests of property holders could still charge rents, and accumulate unearned contribution points. In order to achieve full democracy, two other changes are needed to the current system, and one change to our new system.\n\nFirst, shareholder corporations must transition to worker associations. The reason for this is that shareholder corporations, and generally any ownership-based corporation, act as wealth \"concentrators\", giving a few people the ability to charge rents. If we were to implement the Social Economy only as PMI and contribution points, people with ownership stakes in companies would receive outsized contribution points for their actual labor. This gives us a clear understanding of the bad deals the current system enacts. In order to undo this, we set a date, allowing workers to organize, and negotiate buyouts with former owners through the SEC or another similar body. Typically these will be some form of share to IOU conversion, giving former owners a claim on excess income until paid (within certain bounds, on both sides). Former owners receive excess contribution points for this income, as their compensation for allowing the buyouts to proceed.  \n  \nOnce the Social Economy is up and running with worker associations, former employees now guide every economic decision, extending the democracy of the market to businesses themselves, and making contribution points truly accountable to the actual labor of those earning them. This is so, since with worker control of production, workers set wages for their co-workers, valuing their labor \"fairly\".[1]  \n  \nWorker associations take us most of the way to making contribution points a legible marker of social contribution, but we require one other change to the current system to make them exactly equivalent, and prevent capital accumulation and rent seeking. We must end leases and rents. It makes no sense to end shareholder rent behavior and still allow people to charge interest, either for mortgages or leases, or any other form of payment. The Social Economy transitions mortgages, credit, leases, loans, and all other forms of finance to transfer agreements in PMI.[2] Simultaneously, it converts rental agreements (leases) to mortgages, so that former renters now own their homes and other property.  \n  \nTransfer agreements are formal contracts encoded in the transaction processing system between two parties for some number of payments over some period. The full payment amount of a transfer agreement may not be more than the fair market value of the good or service paid for, plus (or minus) some percentage calculated from the moving average of increase (or decrease) in average PMI value. For example, if the economy were to be on an upward trend, the moving average percentage change of average PMI value over some months might be 5%. So a transfer agreement for a 100 PMI car could be made for 105 PMI.  \n  \nGift funding is a new system that allows people (who now have equal purchasing power) to aggregate their purchasing power into blocks for others to make large purchases with. This fully replaces finance and health insurance, and fully enacts economic democracy. How it works is that people stake some portion of contribution points to start a request for themselves or someone else. The number of contribution points is proportional to the amount of the request in PMI. Once started, others can also stake some amount of contribution points, proportional to the amount of the request, in order to give credence to the validity of the request. Both the original poster and any others staking contribution points this way lose all of them if the request is not fully funded, however, those joining in to validate a truly valid request receive 20% extra contribution points back when funded.  \n  \nOnce the market for funding requests is active in this way, we allow everyone to contribute some amount of PMI to any request they wish. If they do, they receive contribution points according to the square root rule on the average PMI value of the gift. This gives people without an income a way to earn contribution points.  \n  \nWith gift funding active, the Social Economy is mostly complete. We have equalized purchasing power, giving everyone equal footing at the cash register. We have transitioned shareholder corporations to worker associations, ending rent seeking and normalizing labor value. And we have ended finance and interest, replacing them first with transitional transfer agreements, then gift funding.  \n  \nWith all of this active, we now have an economy that is mostly democratic, that is, no one person or group of people can exercise disproportionate control over the means of production, people's taste, or the political narrative. However, this is still not enough to achieve full equality. We still have a competitive market, with worker associations vying for share, driven by the contribution point wish of their workers. This being so, we have merely moved the competitive drive and its vices from former owners to the worker associations themselves.  \n  \nThis is vastly better than the current system for all the outlined reasons, especially that businesses are governed by their workers in aggregate, however, worker associations still may have perverse incentives (perverse being any incentive that causes a drive for inequality). We have not removed the accumulative power of worker associations themselves, merely given control of these mechanisms to democratic bodies formed of the workers doing the labor.  \n  \nIn order to ensure that worker associations don't grow without bound, we legislate that no worker association may hold assets unrelated to their business. Additionally, we do not allow mergers or acquisitions.  \n  \nIn order to control the growth and market behavior of these new entities, we also introduce worker credits.  \n  \nWorker credits function in the following way. Any worker association wishing to hire someone must spend a worker credit. Worker credits are offered on auction every month, and any association with worker points may participate, spending any number of points in any number of bids. To earn points for these auctions, associations participate in gift funding in the same way as anyone else.  \n  \nThis means that the associations that can achieve the most growth are those that contribute the most to the general welfare. It also means that worker associations have a secondary purpose beyond satisfying the market, and that is providing funding for large purchases, and funding the most worthy causes. And in contrast to the current system, this isn't merely virtue signaling: an association's growth depends on being actually social in this way.  \n  \nTo further reward the most social associations, we introduce the Cooperation Index. This is calculated in the following way (remembering that all transactions flow through IRS or another body at this point). First, group all individual association monthly bi-directional payments by payer IDs, then rank by amount. Calculate a cooperation value by the power series E[p_n ^ n] where p_n is the nth greatest trade relationship amount, dividing by worker count. Then, put all association cooperation values in distribution, taking the z-score of a given value as its index.[3]  \n  \nWe use this in the following way. Whenever an association bids for worker credits in auction, (Which they can do in any number and size of bets, the system taking the highest bids one to one with credits) their bid is either multiplied or divided by their Cooperation Index, multiplied if positive, divided if negative.  \n  \nWith all of this, we have an economy based not on accumulation, but on contribution. Both contributing to others through your unique skillful labor, but also through your altruism, both in aggregate as worker associations, and as private citizens.  \n  \nThe reason this matters beyond the humanitarian concerns has to do with AI risk. In nearly all of the disaster scenarios outlined on LW recently, the AI achieves its goal by compromising the economic system to achieve inhuman ends.  \n  \nThe Social Economy removes this ability in two ways. First, all economic activity is guided by worker associations, democratic bodies that determine if their activity is valued. Second, and most importantly, the Social Economy removes survival pressure from economic relationships. This means that no economic coercion is possible, and so no amoral, acquisitive, or disaffected person can be convinced to do something that might harm everyone else.  \n  \nThat's all she wrote.

      "content": "Published on March 11, 2025 9:01 PM GMT  \n  \n\n\nI have an embarrassing secret: I genuinely believe that _Pierre Bourdieu_, the famous french sociologist, had deep insights worth digging for.\n\nIt's embarrassing for a host of reasons. First, I haven't read or studied much Bourdieu. So this is not even the deep pronouncement of an expert, just the confused intuitions of a dilettante. The second source of embarassement is more sociological: the kind of crowds I frequent, my friends and family, are not really the ones to like stuff like Bourdieu (with a few exceptions). It's too continental, too fuzzy, smells too much of bullshit. It fails to provide clear predictions and commitment for its \"theories\", whatever they are.\n\nDespite these deep-seated counter-arguments, the idea to finally study Bourdieu for real this time bubbles up in my mind, over and over again. Maybe I chance a look upon one of the many Bourdieusian tomes in my antilibrary; maybe I just chain thoughts until they reach the vicinity of the sunken insight I feel from the man himself; maybe I just reread old notes and posts that point to or evoke this obscure intuition.\n\nIf I have to express this thought, at like-share-subscribe-point, my mortification redoubles: it's not even about Bourdieu's theories or subject matter.\n\nI'm not against sociology, it's just not my focal point here. Rather, what I diffusely smell from Bourdieu's own words, and from the shape of sociology itself, is an unmined vein of methodological insights.\n\nHow can I expect powerful methods if I don't know the theories, if even my vague understanding suggest a less than stellar success at predicting, modelling, making sense?\n\nBecause what pulls me in Bourdieu is not the positive tricks, methods, and theories — it's the thoughtful recognition of the raggedness of the epistemological terrain.\n\nIn a way, I see Bourdieu himself not as the prophet of the right method, but as the erudite companion to the methodological difficulties of sociology, and then of social sciences, and then of human-involved endeavours in general.\n\nIt is precisely because sociology is so hard and tricky, because I expect at most fragments of answers and nuggets of insights, not the full breadth of a fitting totalizing theory, that I hope reflections on its practice brim with pearls and treasures. And the little that I've read from him makes me confident Bourdieu is a great fountain of such reflections, in books like \" _Le Métier de Sociologue_\" and \" _Sociologie Générale_\"\n\nOnce again, my shameful admission to not have digged deep enough to find, polish, and present any of these hypothetized jewels, means I do not have any finished example to display.\n\nInstead, the train of thought that led me again to Bourdieu, this time in front of my keyboard, suggests a more general, and so less dependent on my lackluster knowledge, inquiry: what is the pattern here? Why do I feel so much more drawn to this particular author, in this particular field, than many of the alternatives? Why of all people and all domains do I expect Bourdieu's sociological reflections to illuminate the deep recesses of methodological difficulties?\n\nI have a tentative answer in two parts.\n\nOn the side of choosing a field, my pet theory is that different domains have different methodological lessons depending (among other things) on their levels of success.\n\nBy and large, I expect fields where the core questions (be they theoretical as in scientific fields or practical as in artistic, design, engineering fields) are mostly solved, to offer a bounty of tricks, techniques, and languages.\n\nThis is what I see as the positive side of comparative methodology: collecting instances of particular successes, and looking for links: are these two instances the same method? Is there a more general pattern underlying them? How do they differ in implementation details, effectiveness, failure modes, and what does that tell us about the method itself, and its context of applicability?\n\nA concrete example of such a study (which I probably need to write down and publish eventually) is my deep-dive last year into what I call the \"tree reconstruction method\".\n\nThis takes a set of objects (manuscripts, species, languages...) and based on comparing how they differ, reconstructs a genealogical tree for these objects. In addition, the method might help reconstruct an idealized[1] ancestor to some or all the objects.\n\nOne of many revelations from comparing the main instances of this method ( _textual criticism_, _historical linguistics_, _phylogenetics_), is that the likelihood of convergent changes/errors affect the implementation details of the method.\n\nConcretely, in phylogenetics, convergent evolution is quite a rare and big visible thing, which means that all differences can be assumed to have a common ancestor, then from these various potential reconstructed trees, we can use heuristics to detect the few cases of convergent evolution. Whereas in textual criticism, there are a set of errors (called polygenetic) which can really easily occur independently: typos, adaptations to local dialects, adding or removing empty words that don't change the meaning much... These also happen far more frequently that the big monogenetic errors which are actually inherited by copying, and on which the tree reconstruction method relies.\n\nThis means that applying reconstruction software (mostly designed for phylogenetics) to massive amounts of data works as is in phylogenetics, but require massive filtering of polygenetic errors by expert in textual criticism if you don’t want to overindex on polygenetic errors.\n\nIn that way, methods get abstracted and characterized through the comparative study of successful fields.\n\nBut what about unsuccessful fields, or only partially successful fields?\n\nWell, I believe such unlucky domains to be the perfect environment to study methodological problems, as opposed to solutions.\n\nThis is because people tend to try methods that work somewhere everywhere. A difficult enough field that has existed for decades must have some fundamental difficulty, a hard kernel on which the obvious tricks broke their teeth.\n\nMost social sciences, including sociology, are an example here, where they are far from a full theory of their chosen topic, and even worse, provide many contradictory answers to the same question. Same nutrition and many areas of medicine. That even applies to subfields and subquestions within fields: the _P vs NP problem_ is where new fancy methods in complexity theory come to get humbled.\n\nThe take I often hear is that these fields failed because people in them were less smart, less competent, less driven, or some similar insult. Yet given the abyssal success rate of the people coming from the \"smart fields\" (wink wink physics) when tackling these problems from \"bad/stupid fields\", I believe instead that a big part of the explanation lies in the underlying epistemic irregularities.\n\nPut it another way, the structures and scaffolds on which most successful methods rely just disappear when you reach one of the hard domains.\n\nWhich is exactly why such fields, if tilled adequately, can reveal so much about epistemic irregularities.\n\nWhereas the practitioner of a successful field simply applies their trick, method, and language, often without having to reflect, the weary explorer of an inhospitable field must learn, eventually, why all his attempts end in failure.\n\nWhen such reflexion is conducted by a bright and thoughtful individual or community, it reveals deep underlying patterns.\n\nMy favorite example is the set of barriers to the P vs NP question. This problem proved so vexing that complexity theorists actually formalized the existence of at least _three \"barriers\"_ that any answer to the million dollar ( _literally_) question must leap over to stand a chance.[2]\n\nSociology, I expect, is a great hard field to ripe such a harvest. It is old enough that the same bottlenecks have been encountered again and again, it has enough funding and prestige to attract non-trivial numbers of brilliant individuals, and it clearly tackles one instance of the ever-shifting and ever-resisting-methods human domain.\n\nWhich leads me to the second part of my answer: sociology, okay, but why Bourdieu?\n\nHe has the right vibe. That's about it.[3]\n\nIf I try a little more to legibilize my intuitions, he clearly thought long and hard about how sociology works, and why it is hard. After all, he wrote a whole book on how to be a sociologist, and his courses at the College de France start with weeks of him digging into the difficulties of sociology.\n\nMore broadly, he seems to have the right mixture of practicality (actually going in the field to study concrete examples), reflectivity (his obvious philosophical bent), and pedagogy (courses at the College de France like his were meant to educate any french citizen who wanted to get in, which requires a deep levelling down of prerequisites and an explicitation of tacit knowledge).\n\nI might be wrong.\n\nWhen and if I pluck the grapes of sociological hardness ripened by Bourdieu, I might find them sour. Or even more disappointing, flavorless.\n\nFor the moment, they still look ripe to me, though.\n\n  1.  **^**\n\nIt is idealized because it tend to compress variations across both space and time into a single instance, which might therefore never have existed. See _my post on proto-languages_ for one such example.\n\n  2.  **^**\n\nAnother project in my long-list is to find a more general methodological interpretation to these barriers. I swear it exists. Somewhere. Somehow.\n\n  3.  **^**\n\nIf I'm honest, a little bit of this vibe comes from Bourdieu's use and respect for the work of _Gaston Bachelard_, my favorite philosopher of science. But justifying and making palatable Bachelard is beyond my energy and my scope for today.\n\n\n  \n  \nDiscuss",
